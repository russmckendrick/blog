Hello Music Maniacs! 🎵🔥

I'm back again with Mckendrick's weekly mixtape. My whole week’s been documented through my musical taste – shout out to my Last.fm profile – where my soundtracks paint an auditory picture of my lived experiences. You can follow my musical journey here at [my Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick).

As some of you might be aware, I've been entrusting my blog's composition to artificial intelligence lately, and here's another fine piece of AI craftsmanship!🤖🎵

Topping my most-played list was the indisputable 'Stars'. In a world strewn with talent, Stars continues to dominate my audio universe with its memorable emo-pop vibes 🌟. Their exquisite blending of electronic textures and anthemic pop hooks is as much cinematic as it is poignant, making their music my go-to for moments of introspection and thrilling road trips. Is it strange that I find the heartbreak laced lyrics so soothing? If it’s wrong, I don't want to be right!

Additionally, 'David Bowie' has been on heavy rotation. Bowie’s chameleonic ability to never fall into a musical rut is always impressive 🚀. Ziggy Stardust ever altering, his music was seductive, charming and passionate, straddling genres as he transcended the boundaries of what rock and pop could be. I feel like this week I have been on a trip through the galaxy!

My nostalgia meter peaked with 'Soft Cell'. Their intimate synth-pop tunes scoring high in my perpetual quest for that retro allure. 'Tainted Love', anyone? It's a classic that always manages to creep into my playlists now and then.☎️📟

Not to forget, 'R.E.M.' has been feeding my soul frequently. Their ethereal alt-rock soundtracks that navigate the landscapes of emotion are always captivating. 'Losing My Religion' hits deep every darn time! 🎸

Progressive rock lovers, where you at? 'Thank You Scientist' and 'A Perfect Circle' made a righteous appearance on my playlist. Unpredictable song structures, cool dissonances, and their hypnotic melodies took me into the magical lair of tonal catharsis. 🤘

The haunting complexity of 'Oceansize' imprinted deep traces. Their music is a colossal sonic experience to dive in; it's all-consuming and atmospheric, the stuff of aural dreams 🌊.

'Peter Gabriel' had to be on this list. His inventive pop and globally conscious albums hold a powerful influence. The soulful ballads, the rhythmic energy, and the lyrical depth in Gabriel's music continue to be a force to resonate with. 🌏

This week I also grooved to the cool tunes of 'Booth & The Bad Angel'. Their soul-stirring musical melodies filled my room while I got lost in their tuneful enchantment. A hidden gem indeed! 💎

For the ska and reggae fans out there, yes, you guessed it, 'Hepcat' was in the house. Their spirited tunes blended with deep-rooted Jamaican vibes swirled around in my musical realm 💃.

Psychedelia from the '70s hit me hard this week with 'Pink Floyd' making multiple appearances. From 'Comfortably Numb' to 'Wish You Were Here', it was a sonically glorious week indeed! 🌙

Finally, I have been swimming in the wry indie-folk brought to us by 'Jim Bob'. His witticisms brilliantly layered over the catchy hooks had me all charmed up. This man's world is one I keenly continue to explore 🎤.

So that's my week, etched in audio rhythms and lyrical poetry. Feels like I have thoroughly enjoyed a cultural mixtape, expressing my feelings embedded within the notes of music. As sure as the moon follows the sun, next week I'll have a whole new batch of tracks to share. 🌞

Till then, keep streaming and creating your beautiful soundtrack of life! 🎵❤️

Rock on,
Russ Mckendrick + AI 🤟
