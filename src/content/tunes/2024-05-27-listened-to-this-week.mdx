### Introduction 🌈
In 1996, a little-known band from Glasgow called Belle and Sebastian released their debut album, "Tigermilk." Crafted as a college project by Stuart Murdoch and his classmates, this album was initially limited to just 1,000 vinyl copies. Little did they know, it was the beginning of what would become an iconic journey in the indie pop landscape.
