# My Latest Soundtracks: The Melodious Decluttering of My Ears!üéµü•Å

Greetings music lovers! Well, it's that time of the week where we gather around virtually and share our recent playlist obsessions. As a music enthusiast, my taste is as assorted as a kid's pick-n-mix sweets selection. Timeless classics, fresh tracks, and unheard gems - they all find their way into my eclectic playlist rotation. I'm excited to share my most played artist and the myriad of melodious flavors my ears have indulged in during this past week.

Oh, and before I unravel the tracks that had my toes tapping and head nodding all week, know this - all the data for this week's post is faithfully collated by [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick) where my music listening tool tracks my sonic journey in real-time. Also, fun fact, this part was AI-generated! Kinda cool, huh? Now, let‚Äôs dive right into the musical abyss!üåä

First off, we need a drumroll here... ü•Å *drumroll speaks louder than words...drumroll speaks louder than words*...and the top accolades go to ‚Äì the Jurassic 5!üèÜ This week, I've been swaying to their eclectic fusion of old-school hip hop, jazz rhythms, and jumpy beats. They undoubtedly seized the crown this time. 

These rhythmic word wizards weaved their storytelling magic, with tracks like 'Concrete Schoolyard' and 'Jayou.' Their unique ability to combine wordplay with thumping bass lines and slick DJ cuts compelled me to put their sounds on repeat. Funny how their unique blend of timeless sounds transcends the limits, and captures the essence of a particular time, place, or feeling. That's the beauty of the Jurassic 5! üëë

But the J5 isn't the sole inhabitant of my magical auditory land. I have also been jamming to some other epic sounds.

Soundtracking my morning brew this week was Silver Sun, whose 'Bubblegum' track has just the right amount of morning mojo. Pavement kept the ball rolling with 'Range Life', the perfect backdrop to my afternoon saunters. 

Evenings were all about kicking back with The Breeders (kinda obsessed with 'Driving on 9') and the sultry baritone-driven stories of Richard Hawley, with 'Tonight The Streets Are Ours' adding a touch of drama to my nocturnal sessions. 

In between, I found hidden treasures in the sounds of Brad, Def Leppard (an enduring love), and Curtis Mayfield. '20th Century Boy', a Brad's gem, tagged along in my evening walks, while 'Pour Some Sugar On Me' by Def Leppard became my guilty pleasure. Curtis Mayfield's 'Move On Up' added a unique sway to my steps. Not to forget, 'I Say Nothing' by Voice Of The Beehive was a blissful find!

To douse the tastes of nostalgia, I tapped into Voice of The Beehive‚Äôs rock-pop tunes. And in a flight of fancy, I dabbled with Aphex Twin's divine realm of electronica. 

I wrapped up the week with some stirring riffs and sweeping landscapes of 'Red Eyes' from The War on Drugs and Richard Hawley, creating a goodnight serenade with 'For Your Lover, Give Some Time.'

Phew! My playlist journey took me from the heady hits of the Jurassic ages to the poetic whispers of Hawley, truly a melodious rollercoaster! üé¢ Yet, this is just the end of another week, and the start of a new sound-filled journey. Stay tuned for the next week's audiotrack adventures!

In the meantime, I would love to hear what melodies are massaging your eardrums. Drop a comment and let's debate, disseminate, and deconstruct the world of spectacular sounds! üé∂
