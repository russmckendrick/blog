## Hit Parade 1979–2024 + Bonus 7 Single by Madness 🎶

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/Hit-Parade-1979-2024-Bonus-7-Single.jpg" alt="Hit Parade 1979-2024 + Bonus 7&quot; Single by Madness" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & creation 🛠️
This is less a new studio album and more a lovingly curated career anthology — the band hand-picked 45 singles spanning their debut in 1979 through 2024. Released in late 2025, the set was assembled with care: new liner notes (including interviews with producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley) and fresh essays by Paul Sexton give context to each era. The package isn’t just a run-through of hits — it includes rare single edits and mixes that haven’t appeared on previous compilations, plus a special bonus 7 single featuring “Bed & Breakfast Man” and “Madness (The Singles That Never Were).” Formats range from a 2CD set to two color LPs (translucent red and blue), and a deluxe 4LP box — perfect for collectors.

### Musical style 🎺
What makes this collection sing is how it maps Madness’s stylistic chameleon act: early ska and 2-Tone energy (“One Step Beyond,” “Baggy Trousers”) sits next to pop-smarts and music‑hall flourishes (“Our House,” “It Must Be Love”). Later singles like “Lovestruck” and “NW5” show a band still flexible enough to absorb contemporary sounds without losing that unmistakable “nutty” personality. Across decades you hear tight horn lines, singalong choruses, witty lyrical storytelling about everyday British life, and a production aesthetic shaped repeatedly by Langer & Winstanley.

### Cultural impact 🇬🇧

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/Madness.jpg" alt="Madness" fullWidth="true" />

Madness are woven into the British soundtrack: their songs crop up in adverts, films, and fête playlists, and moves like the “nutty” dancing and memorable videos cemented their place in pop culture. They helped popularize ska in the UK, scored a No.1 with “House of Fun,” and racked up dozens of Top 40 hits. This Hit Parade acts as a time capsule of working-class London identity, youthful mischief, romance and domestic satire — delivered with tongue firmly in cheek.

### Legacy ✨
Beyond the nostalgia, the compilation underscores why Madness are more than a retro act: they’ve influenced later Britpop and storytelling pop acts, stayed a festival and arena draw, and continued to create music that resonates across generations. The inclusion of rare mixes and the bonus 7 gives long-time fans new treasures, while the comprehensive tracklist makes this the ideal entry point for anyone discovering the band. In short: Hit Parade is a celebration — an affectionate, often funny, and musically rich portrait of a band that helped define British pop for nearly half a century.

## Enzcyclopedia - Volumes One & Two by Split Enz 🎭

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/Enzcyclopedia-Volumes-One-Two.jpg" alt="Enzcyclopedia - Volumes One & Two by Split Enz" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & Creation 🎚️
Released in November 2025 to mark the 50th anniversary of the band’s beginnings, ENZcyclopedia Volumes One & Two is a lovingly compiled archival box that shines a floodlight on Split Enz’s formative years (1973–1976). The set gathers remastered editions of Mental Notes (1975) and Second Thoughts (1976), plus The Beginning of the Enz — early singles, rarities and previously unreleased tracks. The restoration work leans on original masters (remastering credited to Phil Kinrade at AIR Studios) and a fresh 2025 stereo remix of Second Thoughts by Eddie Rayner that many listeners call “bigger and brighter” without losing the record’s original oddness. Fun studio image: Second Thoughts was cut at Basing Street in London with Phil Manzanera in the producer’s seat — reportedly while Bob Marley was working on Exodus downstairs.

### Musical Style 🎸
What makes this material stand out is its strange, theatrical alchemy. Early Split Enz mixed art-rock, prog flourishes, folkish melodies and outright eccentric theatre: odd time signatures, quirky arrangements, and narrative lyrics from the Tim Finn–Phil Judd axis. Mental Notes balances catchy hooks with surreal musical detours; Second Thoughts pushes the production and experimentation further under Manzanera’s gloss. Across the set you’ll hear how the band flirted with accessibility while delighting in sonic unpredictability — the sort of music that can be both oddly comforting and disorienting in the best possible way.

### Cultural Impact 🌏

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/Split-Enz.jpg" alt="Split Enz" fullWidth="true" />

Split Enz’s visual and musical identity changed what listeners in Australasia expected from a rock band. Their makeup, costumes and stagecraft became as important as their songs and created a template for later art-pop and new wave acts in New Zealand and Australia. ENZcyclopedia makes clear how the band’s theatricality and refusal to sit inside any one genre opened doors for future artists — you can trace lines from these early recordings through Tim and Neil Finn’s later work and onto Crowded House’s international success.

### Legacy 🔁
This box is more than nostalgia: it’s a reclamation. The package (available as a 5-CD set, 3-LP set and Atmos Blu‑Ray) includes a 40‑page booklet, unreleased tracks, Noel Crombie’s new sleeve design, and commentary from Tim Finn, Eddie Rayner, Mike Chunn and Phil Manzanera. Critics have praised the set as “weird, wild and wonderful,” and it’s reignited interest in the band’s early experiments. For newcomers it’s a perfect entry point; for long-term fans it’s a treasure trove — archival care that cements Split Enz’s place as New Zealand’s most influential export of that era.

## The Best of Everything But the Girl by Everything But the Girl 🎧

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/The-Best-of-Everything-But-The-Girl.jpg" alt="The Best of Everything But The Girl by Everything But the Girl" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & creation 🎙️
Released in 1996, this compilation gathers recordings spanning 1982–1994, tracing Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt’s steady reinvention. The collection was issued on Blanco y Negro in the UK on 28 October 1996 (a US release followed later), and many editions were remastered — some cuts handled by Miles Showell at Abbey Road — to give older tracks a cleaner edge alongside the duo’s more recent electronic work. The sequencing feels intentional: it opens with the club-ready high points (the Todd Terry remixes that made them global) and winds back into their tender, acoustic-led origins. You’ll find everything from early jazz-tinged pop and orchestral balladry to collaborations like “Protection” with Massive Attack and the dancefloor-shaping “Missing (Todd Terry Remix).”

### Musical style 🎛️
What makes this compilation stand out is its clear portrait of stylistic evolution. Early tracks such as “Each and Every One” showcase their jazz-folk, literate pop — intimate arrangements, Tracey’s warm, conversational voice and Ben’s tasteful guitar and production. By the mid-90s, the palette shifts: drum machines, fractured beats, and house remixes dominate (“Missing,” “Driving”), while trips into trip-hop textures appear via the Massive Attack connection. The album is not a genre exercise but a study in adaptation: orchestral strings and acoustic melancholy sit comfortably beside syncopated club edits and electronic soul.

### Cultural impact 🌍

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/Everything-But-the-Girl.jpg" alt="Everything But the Girl" fullWidth="true" />

The compilation highlights how one single remix can reframe a career. Todd Terry’s take on “Missing” transformed a hushed ballad into a global club and radio hit — peaking high in charts worldwide and introducing the duo to an audience that had largely missed their earlier records. Their collaborations bridged scenes: indie-pop sensibility met UK dance culture and Bristol’s trip-hop, helping normalize cross-pollination between singer-songwriter songwriting and electronic production. The Best of Everything But the Girl also became a common entry point for listeners discovering the band in the late ’90s; the record earned Platinum status in the UK and remains their most widely recognized summary.

### Legacy ✨
As a snapshot, this compilation does more than collect singles — it narrates a rare career arc from bedsit balladeers to clubroom confidants. It’s been remastered and reissued over the years and still functions as a neat primer for newer fans (and a nostalgic package for long-timers). Fun fact: Tracey and Ben’s long creative partnership eventually became a life partnership; they married in 2009. Decades on, their influence is audible across folktronica and modern indie-pop that comfortably flirts with electronic beats — and their 2023 return only reaffirmed how resilient and adaptable their songwriting truly is.

## Come on Feel the Lemonheads by The Lemonheads 🎸

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/Come-on-Feel-the-Lemonheads.jpg" alt="Come on Feel the Lemonheads by The Lemonheads" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & Creation 🎧
Released October 12, 1993, this is the record where Evan Dando’s knack for melody met full-band ambition. The sessions were mostly cut at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood with the Robb Brothers producing — the same team behind It’s a Shame About Ray — but there were touches recorded back in Boston, too. The atmosphere in the studio was famously loose and occasionally chaotic: songs often came together in late-night bursts, and Dando’s well-documented struggles with drugs added an unpredictable energy to the process. Guests drifted in and out — Juliana Hatfield lends harmonies, and the record features a handful of high-profile cameos — which gave the album a communal, almost lived-in feel.

### Musical Style & Songs 🎶
What makes this album stand out is its fusion of power-pop hooks, slacker-era confessionalism, and a punk-to-folk sensibility. Tracks zip between jangly, upbeat numbers and quieter, more vulnerable moments. “Into Your Arms” became the big sing-along — it hit No. 1 on the US Modern Rock chart — but cuts like “The Great Big No” and “It’s About Time” show the band’s talent for tight arrangements and bittersweet lyrics. Dando’s voice is warm and direct, sometimes weary, and the production favors immediacy over gloss: guitars ring, vocal harmonies sit close, and the record breathes like a band playing in the same room.

### Cultural Impact 🌍

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/The-Lemonheads.jpg" alt="The Lemonheads" fullWidth="true" />

Come on Feel the Lemonheads arrived at the height of the alt-rock boom but refused to be boxed into grunge. It was too melodic, too slyly humorous, and too tender for that. The record helped broaden what alternative radio could be — emotional honesty, popcraft, and a willingness to sound a little fragile all at once. Dando’s off-stage persona (celebrity friendships and tabloid-friendly antics) only amplified the album’s mythology: he was the charming, cranky frontman who could write a sublime three-minute heartbreak song and then be late to the next session.

### Legacy & Why It Still Matters 🔁
Critics were mixed on its consistency, but fans kept coming back. The album peaked at No. 56 on the Billboard 200 and No. 19 in the U.K., and it’s now seen as a 90s staple that influenced later intimate indie songwriters. Its 30th-anniversary reissues and archival material underscore how those imperfect performances and ragged edges are part of the appeal. In short: Come on Feel the Lemonheads captures a specific moment — messy, melodic, and honest — and still sounds like a vital, human record decades later.

## Nothing But Love // The Definitive Best Of by James 🎶

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/Nothing-But-Love-The-Definitive-Best-Of.jpg" alt="Nothing But Love // The Definitive Best Of by James" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & Creation 🛠️
Released in November 2025, Nothing But Love is less a throwaway greatest-hits package and more a lovingly assembled biography in sound. The band hand-picked and remastered tracks spanning their career — sequenced chronologically from the Jimone EP through landmark albums and rare early singles — so you hear James grow, stumble, and reinvent themselves. The set appears as a 3CD / 5LP box with a 14‑page booklet of band commentary; that booklet is a treat, full of first‑hand stories about why certain B‑sides or odd early mixes mattered enough to keep. The package also contains two brand‑new songs, “Wake Up Superman” and “Hallelujah Anyhow,” produced by Leo Abrahams, which sound like the same band you know but with fresh textures and a renewed sense of purpose.

### Musical Style & Sound 🌈
What makes this collection sing is its breadth. One minute you have the communal, arms‑around‑each‑other singalongs that made them stadium‑famous, the next you’re in hushed, atmospheric territory — layers of synths, delicate guitars and Tim Booth’s healing, theatrical voice. The remasters favour warmth and clarity, bringing out details in older recordings without flattening their rawness. “Hallelujah Anyhow” in particular reworks older motifs (it gestures back to “Pieces of Gum”) into lush harmonies and modern synthscapes; it’s a neat example of how James can recontextualize their past rather than simply revisit it.

### Cultural Impact & Context 🌍

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/James.jpg" alt="James" fullWidth="true" />

James emerged from Manchester in 1982 and have always been a band that straddles indie credibility and mass connection. This anthology does something important culturally: it reframes the group beyond the narrow radio shorthand of “Sit Down” and “Laid.” By including early Rough Trade versions, B‑sides like “All Good Boys,” and rarities such as the long‑shelved “I Defeat” (with Sinéad O’Connor), the collection places James as a persistent influence on British alternative music — a band whose experiments and emotional honesty have been quietly imitated across generations.

### Legacy & Why It Matters 🏆
The set reads as a statement: James are still evolving. With 18 studio albums behind them and recent success (their 2024 album Yummy hit No.1 in the UK), Nothing But Love cements their reputation not just as hitmakers but as adventurous songwriters and communal performers. Including the original Rough Trade single of “Sit Down” for the first time in decades and unreleased rarities gives fans context and newcomers a deep, rewarding entry point. If you’ve only ever known James for a chorus, this anthology will make you hear the rest of the sentence — complex, generous, and louder than you remembered.

## Always (The Very Best Of Erasure) by Erasure 🎹✨

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/Always-The-Very-Best-Of-Erasure.jpg" alt="Always (The Very Best Of Erasure) by Erasure" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & Creation 🛠️
Released on 30 October 2015 to mark Erasure’s 30th anniversary, Always (The Very Best Of Erasure) is less a rushed cash-in and more a lovingly curated career snapshot. The three-CD set spans 43 tracks arranged largely chronologically, which makes listening feel like flipping through a synth-pop scrapbook — from early singles like Who Needs Love Like That to later club-ready cuts such as Be With You. The compilation also includes fresh studio attention: a newly reworked version of Sometimes by producer David Wrench and several updated remixes and edits that give familiar songs a modern sheen. Vince Clarke’s production fingerprints—you can hear his modular approach and ear for hooky synth lines—remain the through-line tying decades together.

### Musical Style 🎶
What makes this collection stand out is its demonstration of Erasure’s melodic consistency and stylistic flexibility. Early tracks capture 80s gleam—bright arpeggios, simple yet irresistible chord progressions, and Andy Bell’s emotive, vibrato-tinged vocals. As the set moves into the 90s and 00s you hear a shift toward fuller, club-oriented arrangements, richer pads and trance-flavored anthems. The remixes included (from collaborators and internal reworks) spotlight Erasure’s adaptability: their songs translate as well to intimate pop as they do to peak-time dancefloors. The balance of tenderness and euphoria—balladry alongside high-energy synth-pop—remains constant.

### Cultural Impact 🌈

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/Erasure.jpg" alt="Erasure" fullWidth="true" />

Erasure have always been more than just chart hits; they’re touchstones for queer visibility in pop music. Andy Bell’s openness and celebratory lyrics helped carve out space where love and desire weren’t coded or tragic but joyous. Songs like A Little Respect and Sometimes function as anthems across clubs and pride events, and this compilation underscores that cultural resonance. The inclusion of modern remixes also shows how younger producers and DJs keep their catalog vital in contemporary electronic contexts.

### Legacy 🔁
Always confirms Erasure’s place as architects of modern synth-pop. The compilation became a neat entry point for new fans and a generous trip down memory lane for longtime listeners — sparking debates (notably over the updated Sometimes) that demonstrate the passion of their fanbase. Expanded vinyl and deluxe editions that followed only reinforced how these songs continue to matter—played on radio, in clubs, and at countless personal soundtracks. If you want to understand pop that’s unabashedly affectionate, tuneful, and enduring, this collection makes the case beautifully.

## Dont Bore Us - Get To The Chorus! (Roxettes Greatest Hits) by Roxette 🎶

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/Dont-Bore-Us-Get-To-The-Chorus-Roxettes-Greatest-Hits.jpg" alt="Don&#39;t Bore Us - Get To The Chorus! (Roxette&#39;s Greatest Hits) by Roxette" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & creation 🎙️
Released in October 1995, this first greatest-hits collection arrived when Roxette—Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson—felt untouchable on the pop charts. The compilation gathers their radio-smash era and sprinkles in four new tracks, letting the duo prove they still had fresh hooks to offer. Production credit goes largely to longtime collaborator Clarence Öfwerman, with Gessle and Fredriksson deeply involved in song selection and studio touches. Around the compilation period they even cut intimate acoustic sessions at Abbey Road (broadcast for BBC and used as B-sides), stripping classics down to reveal the songs’ bones—one memorable moment being their fragile cover of The Beatles’ “Help.” The title itself—Don’t Bore Us – Get to the Chorus!—is a cheeky manifesto: no filler, just immediate, unforgettable choruses.

### Musical style & songwriting ✨
What makes this collection sing is Roxette’s obsession with the perfect pop chorus. Their sound blends glossy synth production, big-guitar pop-rock, and Marie’s emotive, crystalline voice riding Per’s knack for anthemic hooks. Tracks like “The Look,” “Listen to Your Heart,” “It Must Have Been Love,” and “Joyride” showcase how they balance stadium-sized melodrama with radio-friendly immediacy. Even the new songs on the set follow the same rulebook—economical verses, a hook-forward chorus, and production that frames Marie’s voice like an instrument in its own right. The Motown-advised aphorism in the title isn’t just cute copy; it’s the creative code they lived by.

### Cultural impact & reception 🌍

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/Roxette.jpg" alt="Roxette" fullWidth="true" />

The album landed as a pop milestone: critics and fans alike praised Roxette’s uncanny ability to make choruses feel like emotional lodestars. AllMusic called it “pop perfection,” while some reviewers noted that a few early production touches sounded slightly dated by the mid‑90s—yet the songs’ melodies carried them through. Commercially, it was enormous: multi-million sales within months and a catalogue that cemented Roxette alongside other great pop-curators like ABBA. Their four US No.1 singles and global radio saturation—“It Must Have Been Love” alone became an enduring film-associated anthem—meant this compilation read like a global pop résumé.

### Legacy & curious facts 🕰️
Beyond sales (millions worldwide), the compilation is often the entry point for new fans discovering Roxette’s catalogue. It also deliberately omits some early Swedish-era material (a selective history rather than an exhaustive one), which helped shape the duo’s international narrative. Fun tidbits: the phrase in the title traces back to hitmaking lore, the Abbey Road acoustic recordings revealed a grimmer, more intimate side of their hits, and the set’s endurance inspired expanded reissues and kept Roxette’s melodic blueprint influential for Scandinavian pop songcraft that followed.

## Bees In The Bonnet by Hedvig Mollestad Trio 🎸🐝

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/Bees-In-The-Bonnet.jpg" alt="Bees In The Bonnet by Hedvig Mollestad Trio" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & Creation 🎚️
Bees In The Bonnet landed in 2025 on Norway’s adventurous Rune Grammofon, arriving like a live set distilled into an album — raw, tight and sonically confident. The trio — Hedvig Mollestad Thomassen (guitar), Ellen Brekken (electric bass) and Ivar Loe Bjørnstad (drums) — recorded after a stretch of solo projects, and you can hear that renewed focus: arrangements that balance meticulously notated charts with wide-open improvisational rooms. The exact studio credits are a bit mysterious, but the production is unmistakable: clear enough to catch every string scrape and cymbal nuance, powerful enough to let the riffs breathe like vintage 70s rock in a modern jazz context. The record was released on vinyl and CD and feels purpose-built for headphones or a loud club.

### Musical Style & Standout Tracks 🎶
What makes Bees In The Bonnet sing is its fearless genre-bending. It’s riff-driven hard rock married to jazz complexity — think Sabbath/Zeppelin heft filtered through European improv sensibilities. The album’s six tracks move from heavy groove to psychedelic detours and slow, melancholic spaces. “See See Bop” opens with a hooked 70s groove; “Golden Griffin” shifts from trippy textures to funk-prog fury; and “Apocalypse Slow” is a tender, balladic tribute to Mollestad’s father, built on an unusual 10-beat pulse. “Itta Lamament” honors a humanitarian worker and showcases shifting meters and lyrical guitar lines. Throughout, the trio’s telepathic interplay and dynamic shifts keep you guessing in the best way.

### Cultural Impact & Reception 🌍

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/Hedvig-Mollestad-Trio.jpg" alt="Hedvig Mollestad Trio" fullWidth="true" />

Critics embraced the album as both wildly entertaining and accessible — a perfect gateway between headbanging and jazz-listening. Reviews celebrated its memorable riffs, adventurous spirit, and the way it makes 1972 feel contemporaneous again. For rock fans curious about jazz, and jazz fans craving raw power, Bees In The Bonnet stakes a persuasive claim: fusion that doesn’t compromise intensity or sophistication.

### Legacy & Why It Matters 🐝✨
As the trio’s eighth studio statement, this record cements Hedvig Mollestad Trio as one of Europe’s leading genre-smashers. Their long-standing lineup (15+ years) gives the music an almost telepathic cohesion that younger bands can only envy. The album’s mix of dedication (personal tributes) and outward-looking titles suggests a band grounded in emotion and engaged with the world. With extensive touring through Europe in 2025 and plans beyond, Bees In The Bonnet feels less like a peak and more like the opening riff of the next chapter.

## Around the World in a Day by Prince & The Revolution 🌍🎶

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/albums/Around-the-World-in-a-Day.jpg" alt="Around the World in a Day by Prince & The Revolution" fullWidth="true" />


### Recording & Creation 🎛️
Prince began work on this one before Purple Rain even hit — and surprisingly, finished it on Christmas Eve 1984, just two weeks after the final Purple Rain tour show. Sessions bounced between Sunset Sound in Hollywood and Prince’s Minneapolis warehouse studios. Much of the album is essentially a Prince solo record: he played most instruments and arranged tracks, while the Revolution’s contributions were limited to a few songs like “America,” “Pop Life,” and “The Ladder.” The title track itself grew out of a demo by David Coleman (Lisa Coleman’s brother), which Prince transformed into the album’s opening psychedelic flourish. Notably, the release was deliberately low-key — no advance singles and minimal promotion — a bold contrast to the Purple Rain machine.

### Musical Style & Songs 🎸🌈
What makes this album stand out is its wholehearted plunge into 1960s psychedelia filtered through Prince’s pop instincts. Think Sgt. Pepper-inspired orchestration, sitar-leaning textures, Middle Eastern flavors, and loose, dreamlike song structures. Lyrically it leans toward spirituality, social questions and tender stories rather than the raw sexuality of earlier records. “Raspberry Beret” and “Pop Life” supply the most immediate pop hooks (Raspberry Beret was actually sketched as early as 1982), while tracks like “Paisley Park” and “The Ladder” explore layered, atmospheric arrangements. Fun studio lore: the single “America” started as a 21-minute rehearsal that got edited down for release.

### Cultural Impact 🌐

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-24-listened-to-this-week/artists/Prince-The-Revolution.jpg" alt="Prince & The Revolution" fullWidth="true" />

Dropping a psychedelic, experimental record immediately after a cultural juggernaut was audacious. Critics were divided at first—some baffled, some enchanted—but the move signaled Prince’s refusal to be boxed in by commercial expectations. The album topped the Billboard 200 and went double platinum, proving that an artist could follow blockbuster success with something challenging and still win the public over. Its vivid artwork and packaging reinforced the shift into a more visionary, less conventional pop persona.

### Legacy ✨
Retrospective takes have warmed considerably: Around the World in a Day is now viewed as a pivotal pivot, an essential act of risk-taking that broadened Prince’s sonic palette and influenced later pop, R&B and alt artists eager to blend genres. It’s a blueprint for artistic reinvention—Prince’s reminder that chart success and creative exploration can coexist. Little moments—like Prince recording most parts himself, George Clinton’s appreciation, and the immediacy of finishing one project while already eyeing the next—make this album a fascinating chapter in his ever-restless career.
