# This Week's Tune Tales: What's Been Rocking My World? 🎵🎸

Hey music enthusiasts, I'm back with a fresh update on my latest auditory adventures 🎧🙌

This week, it was a roller-coaster ride of genres, artists, and emotions. From the classic rock of Pink Floyd and The Who to the mellow vibes of The Decemberists, the eclectic mix has indeed kept me company amidst my mundane routine.

The artist that topped my chart this week is none other than the iconic punk-rock band, The Jam 🎸 As nostalgic as it seems, it never really gets old. Their powerful lyrics, aggressive instrumentation, and high-octane performances always underscore that 'in-your-face' punk attitude that I truly adore.

Listening to The Jam is like taking a trip down the memory lane – a time brimming with powerful political statements and unboxable creativity. With their memorable hits like 'Going Underground' and 'That's Entertainment', their music is pure passion encapsulated in powerful beats. 

While I've been jamming with The Jam, on the softer side, Deacon Blue's harmonious tunes were floating in my ears too 🎵. Their catchy rhythms and passionate lyrics made me lose track of time as I submerged myself in their soothing tunes. I can't help but appreciate their powerful storytelling through music; it's so authentically compelling.

Coming down to my all-time favourites, I spent quite some time with The Smiths this week. I'm yet to find a bad song by these guys (I highly doubt there is one!). Their harmonious blend of Indie and Rock engulfed me in a sea of introspective lyrics that captivated my mind and heart 🎶 

Venturing into the realm of Experimental Rock, my playlist also welcomed the amazing ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. A unique name for a uniquely exceptional band. Their music is the personification of 'expect the unexpected', always keeping me on my toes. It's almost like an art form with their crafty work across different genres.

Now, how could a week pass without me listening to some U2? Their evergreen hits always rekindle my spirit. This week was filled with my faithful appreciation for Bono's soul-stirring voice and the band's easy-to-sing-along anthems. Their music is a raw confession of pure emotion, a reassurance that it's okay to feel.

Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers have also been on my playlist this week. The sweet nostalgia infused with their guitar tenderly strummed never fails to induce a state of relaxation. With the immense contributions of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Decemberists, Def Leppard, The Stone Roses, and The Who, each day of the week was a musically eclectic journey.

While we've reached the end of the list, I'd like to thank my loyal companion, Last.fm, for documenting my musical journey. You can drop by my profile [here](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick) to join in on my musical exploration 🎼
