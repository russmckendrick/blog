[Sysdig](http://www.sysdig.org/) looks like it could be a useful addition to a sysadmins list of tools, it is described as;

> Sysdig is open source, system-level exploration: capture system state and activity from a running Linux instance, then save, filter and analyze. Think of it as strace + tcpdump + lsof + awesome sauce. With a little Lua cherry on top.

It’s easy to [install](http://www.sysdig.org/install/) ….

```bash frame="terminal" title="Sysdig 1/1"
curl -s https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/stable/install-sysdig | sudo bash
```


…. and even easier to run ….

I wish I had something this straight forward when I was doing syadmin work as a day job, you youngsters don’t know how good you have it.
