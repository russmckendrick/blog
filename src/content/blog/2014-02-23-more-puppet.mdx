I have been playing my [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=52ec4dc3647e) server a lot recently. Breaking it, fixing it and then rebuilding it, while I had documented [my puppet installation](/2013/08/31/puppet-server-client-installation-centos-6.x/) it was getting to be a pain to copy and paste with each rebuild, so I pulled together a [few scripts](https://github.com/russmckendrick/puppet-install) from various sources to make the rebuilds a little less of a chore. To install fresh Puppet Master all I need to do now is run the following command;

```bash frame="terminal" title="More Puppet 1/2"
curl -fsS https://raw2.github.com/russmckendrick/puppet-install/master/install | bash
```


and to install an agent run;

```bash frame="terminal" title="More Puppet 2/2"
curl -fsS https://raw2.github.com/russmckendrick/puppet-install/master/agent | bash -s puppet.master.com
```


Finally I have put moved a non-personalised copy of [my main Puppet configuration into a GitHub repo](https://github.com/russmckendrick/puppet).
