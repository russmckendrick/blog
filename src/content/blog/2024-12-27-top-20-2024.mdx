This year has been particularly notable for the long-awaited return of Tears For Fears with "Songs For A Nervous Planet" to The Cure's "Songs Of A Lost World," we've seen legendary artists continuing to push boundaries.

The progressive rock scene has been especially vibrant with strong releases from Frost*, Pure Reason Revolution, and The Pineapple Thief. What's particularly striking about 2024's releases is the diversity of sounds - from Underworld's electronic landscapes in "Strawberry Hotel" to Orville Peck's unique take on country music with "Stampede." The year has demonstrated that established artists can still innovate while staying true to their core sound.
