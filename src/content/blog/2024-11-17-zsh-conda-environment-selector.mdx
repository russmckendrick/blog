Managing Python environments can sometimes feel like navigating a jungle üå¥üêç, especially when dealing with dependency conflicts. To streamline this process, I created a handy Zsh function to add to your [dotfile](/2024/04/02/updating-my-dotfiles/) for switching Conda environments quickly and efficiently. üöÄ Let me walk you through it!

## Why I Needed This Function üõ†Ô∏è
After months of [using Conda to manage Python environments](/2024/04/06/conda-for-python-environment-management-on-macos/) on my macOS machines, I realized I had built up quite a collection. Switching between them manually became tedious. So, I decided to create a quick, interactive function to simplify the process. üéØ

## How It Works üîß
Here‚Äôs the magic in action ‚ú®:

```yaml frame="code" title="Something here (YAML)" showLineNumbers
# Conda Select function with colors and styling
function cs() {
    # Colors and formatting
    local BLUE='\033[0;34m'
    local GREEN='\033[0;32m'
    local YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
    local CYAN='\033[0;36m'
    local BOLD='\033[1m'
    local NC='\033[0m' # No Color
    
    # Get list of conda environments
    local environments=($(conda env list | grep -v '^#' | awk '{print $1}' | grep -v '^$'))
    
    # Print header with styling
    echo "\n${BOLD}${BLUE}üêç Available Conda Environments:${NC}\n"
    
    # Print environments with numbers and colors
    for i in {1..${#environments[@]}}; do
        if [ "${environments[$i]}" = "base" ]; then
            echo "  ${YELLOW}$i)${NC} ${CYAN}${environments[$i]}${NC} ${GREEN}(base)${NC}"
        else
            echo "  ${YELLOW}$i)${NC} ${CYAN}${environments[$i]}${NC}"
        fi
    done
    
    # Get user selection with styled prompt
    echo "\n${BOLD}${BLUE}Enter environment number (${GREEN}1-${#environments[@]}${BLUE}):${NC} "
    read selection
    
    # Validate input
    if [[ "$selection" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] && [ "$selection" -ge 1 ] && [ "$selection" -le "${#environments[@]}" ]; then
        echo "${GREEN}‚úì Activating ${CYAN}${environments[$selection]}${GREEN} environment...${NC}"
        conda activate "${environments[$selection]}"
    else
        echo "${YELLOW}‚ö†Ô∏è  Invalid selection${NC}"
    fi
}
```


## Using the Function ‚ö°
Running the `cs` command brings up a list of your Conda environments with some stylish colors and formatting. üé® All you have to do is pick a number, and the script takes care of the rest!

  options={{

  }}
/>

And there you have it! A quick and stylish way to manage your Python environments in Zsh üêç. Have fun coding and keep your workflows clean and efficient! üöÄ‚ú®
