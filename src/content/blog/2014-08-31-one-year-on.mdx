I just noticed that the [first post](/2013/08/31/puppet-server-client-installation-centos-6.x/) on this blog was made exactly a year ago today.

While the [layout](/tags/blog/) and [blogging engine has changed](/tags/blog/) and I have not posted for [extended periods of time](/2014/07/12/walkabout/) happy birthday to me.
