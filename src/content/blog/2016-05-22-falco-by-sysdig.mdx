Earlier this week the guys over at [sysdig](https://sysdig.com/) announced the availability of Falco, a behavioral security service which is built on top of their core [Open Source sysdig engine](/2014/05/25/sysdig/). As is always the case when I try new things, I launched a [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/52ec4dc3647e) Droplet running CentOS 7.2. Once the Droplet was available I ran the command to [get the basics configured](/2015/06/28/digital-ocean-bootstrap/) on the droplet;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Falco by sysdig 1/6"
curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/russmckendrick/DOBootstrap/master/do-bootstrap.sh | bash
```


Once the Droplet was configured I installed Falco using the repo provided by sysdig by running the following commands;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Falco by sysdig 2/6"
rpm — import https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/DRAIOS-GPG-KEY.public
curl -s -o /etc/yum.repos.d/draios.repo http://download.draios.com/stable/rpm/draios.repo
yum -y install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)
yum -y install falco
```


With Falco installed, I started it up with the following command;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Falco by sysdig 3/6"
service falco start
```


and checked that everything was running as expected;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Falco by sysdig 4/6"
[root@server ~]# service falco status

[root@server ~]#
```


As you can, it was really straight forward to install. Next up I wanted to trigger a rule, looking through the [default ruleset](https://github.com/draios/falco/blob/dev/rules/falco_rules.yaml) I noticed the following;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Falco by sysdig 5/6"
- macro: adduser_binaries
condition: proc.name in (adduser, deluser, addgroup, delgroup)
- rule: user_mgmt_binaries
desc: activity by any programs that can manage users, passwords, or permissions. sudo and su are excluded. Activity in containers is also excluded — some containers create custom users on top of a base linux distribution at startup.
condition: spawn_process and not proc.name in (su, sudo) and not container and (adduser_binaries or login_binaries or passwd_binaries or shadowutils_binaries)
output: “User management binary command run outside of container (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline)”
priority: WARNING
```


So I added a user, as you can see it triggered the rule;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Falco by sysdig 6/6"
[root@server ~]# adduser wibble
[root@server ~]# tail -2 messages
May 22 08:06:58 digitalocean falco: User management binary command run outside of container (user=root command=adduser wibble)
May 22 08:06:58 digitalocean falco: Sensitive file opened for reading by non-trusted program (user=root command=adduser wibble file=/etc/shadow)
```


After this really quick installation and five minutes of messing about with the rules I can already think of several use cases for Falco and will be keeping a close eye on it.

You can find the GitHub repo for Falco at [https://github.com/draios/falco](https://github.com/draios/falco) and also the [announcement post here](https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-falco/).
