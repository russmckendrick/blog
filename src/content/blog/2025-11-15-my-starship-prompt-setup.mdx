I spend alot of time in the terminal on both my home and work machines so have taken the time to get my terminal prompt looking good and I had been using [PowerLine10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for a few years.

After trying to debug why my terminal was opening slowly I spotted the warning below at the top of the projects repo:

<CautionCallout title="PowerLine10k Warning">
- The project has very limited support
- No new features are in the works
- Most bugs will go unfixed
- Help requests will be ignored
</CautionCallout>

I decided it was time for a change.

## Why Starship?

After some quick Googling I decided upon [Starship](https://starship.rs/), it is a cross-shell prompt written in Rust that's fast, customizable, and incredibly feature-rich. Its repo boasts that unlike traditional shell prompts, Starship:

- Works across multiple shells (zsh, bash, fish, PowerShell)
- Is blazingly fast (written in Rust)
- Provides context-aware information
- Supports extensive customization through a simple TOML file
- Has minimal dependencies

That ticks a lot of boxes so I decided to give it a try.

## The Design Philosophy

My prompt design follows a few key principles:

1. **Information density without clutter**: Show relevant context without overwhelming
2. **Visual hierarchy**: Use color and positioning to prioritize information
3. **Gruvbox aesthetics**: Maintain a consistent retro-groove color scheme
4. **Left-to-right narrative**: Left side shows "where I am," right side shows "what's happening"
5. **Look good**: I take a lot of screen shots and do screen shares - so it needs to look good !!!

Now this is a little zoomed in, but this is what my prompt looks like:

## The Color Palette: Gruvbox Dark

I'm using the [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) Dark color scheme, which provides a warm, retro aesthetic that's easy on the eyes during long coding sessions. The palette includes:

- **Orange** (`#d65d0e`): System and user context
- **Yellow** (`#d79921`): Current directory and status
- **Aqua** (`#689d6a`): Git information
- **Blue** (`#458588`): Programming language indicators
- **Purple** (`#b16286`): Time display
- **Red** (`#cc241d`): Battery and critical indicators

## The Prompt Layout

My prompt is divided into segments, connected with powerline-style arrows. Here's the breakdown:

### Left Side: Contextual Information

```toml title="OS and Username Segment (Orange)"
[os]
disabled = false
style = "bg:color_orange fg:color_fg0"

[username]
show_always = true
format = '[ $user ]($style)'
```

The prompt starts with the OS icon (on macOS) and username. While some people hide the username, I keep it visible—it's a quick visual confirmation of which system I'm on, especially when dealing with remote sessions.


```toml title="Directory Segment (Yellow)"
[directory]
format = "[ $path ]($style)"
truncation_length = 3
truncation_symbol = " "
truncate_to_repo = true
```

The current directory is shown with intelligent truncation. If I'm in a git repository, it truncates relative to the repo root. I've also added custom substitutions with icons for common directories, such as `~/Code/`, `~/Documents` and `~/Downloads`:

<LightGallery
  layout={{
    imgs: [
      { src: "/assets/2025-11-15-my-starship-prompt-setup/dir/dir-01.png", alt: "Code" },
      { src: "/assets/2025-11-15-my-starship-prompt-setup/dir/dir-02.png", alt: "Documents" },
      { src: "/assets/2025-11-15-my-starship-prompt-setup/dir/dir-03.png", alt: "Downloads" },
      { src: "/assets/2025-11-15-my-starship-prompt-setup/dir/dir-04.png", alt: "Pictures" },
    ]
  }}
/>

```toml title="Git Metrics Segment (Aqua)"
[git_metrics]
disabled = false
format = '[[+$added]($added_style)/[-$deleted]($deleted_style) ]'
```

This is where things get interesting. The git segment shows four pieces of information:

1. **Branch name** with an icon
2. **Git status** showing staged/modified/untracked files
3. **Git state** for operations like rebasing or merging
4. **Git metrics** showing additions and deletions

<Img src="/assets/2025-11-15-my-starship-prompt-setup/git.png" alt="Git Metrics" />

The metrics feature is particularly useful—at a glance, I can see `+7/-7` to understand the scope of my changes.

**Language Environment Segment** (Blue)

This segment automatically detects and displays icons for active programming environments:

<LightGallery
  layout={{
    imgs: [
      { src: "/assets/2025-11-15-my-starship-prompt-setup/lang/python.png", alt: "Python" },
      { src: "/assets/2025-11-15-my-starship-prompt-setup/lang/nodejs.png", alt: "Node.js" },
      { src: "/assets/2025-11-15-my-starship-prompt-setup/lang/go.png", alt: "Go" },
    ]
  }}
/>

The segment only appears when relevant files are detected in the current directory, keeping the prompt clean when you're not in a project.

### Right Side: Status Information

Using the `$fill` variable, I push status information to the right side of the terminal:

**Time** (Purple)
```toml
[time]
disabled = false
time_format = "%R"
format = '[[ 󰥔 $time ]]'
```

A simple 24-hour clock (e.g., `14:30`). Some find this redundant, but I appreciate having timestamps in my terminal sessions.

**Battery** (Red background)
```toml
[battery]
full_symbol = "󰁹"
charging_symbol = "󰂄"
discharging_symbol = "󰂃"
```

Battery status with appropriate icons. The red background serves as a visual alert when I'm unplugged.

**Command Duration** (Aqua)
```toml
[cmd_duration]
min_time = 2000
format = '[[  $duration ]]'
```

Shows execution time for commands that take longer than 2 seconds. This is invaluable for understanding which operations are slow and need optimization.

**Exit Status** (Yellow)

Displays an error indicator (✖) when the last command failed, along with the exit code.

**Background Jobs** (Orange)

Shows a  icon with a count when there are background jobs running.

### The Command Line

Finally, after all the context, comes the actual command line:

```toml
[character]
success_symbol = '[](bold fg:color_bright_green)'
error_symbol = '[](bold fg:color_bright_red)'
```

A simple `❯` that turns red when the previous command failed. I've also configured vim mode indicators (since I use vi-mode in zsh):

-  Normal mode (green)
-  Replace mode (purple)
-  Visual mode (yellow)

## Performance Considerations

Starship is fast, but I've made a few tweaks to ensure it stays that way:

```toml
scan_timeout = 35
command_timeout = 700
```

The `scan_timeout` controls how long Starship spends looking for context (like git repos), while `command_timeout` limits how long individual modules can run. These values ensure the prompt never feels laggy.

## Installation

Want to use this configuration? Here's how:

1. **Install Starship:**
    ```bash
    brew install starship
    ```

2. **Install a Nerd Font:** The icons require a Nerd Font. I use Hack Nerd Font Mono:
    ```bash
    brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
    brew install font-hack-nerd-font
    ```

3. **Configure your shell:** Add to your `~/.zshrc`:
    ```bash
    eval "$(starship init zsh)"
    ```

4. **Edit your configuration:** Find the configuration at `~/.config/starship.toml`

## Customization Tips

The beauty of Starship is how easy it is to customize. Here are some ideas:

- **Minimize for remote sessions**: Use different configs based on `$SSH_CONNECTION`
- **Add custom modules**: Starship supports custom commands and environment variables
- **Theme variations**: Try different palettes like Tokyo Night, Nord, or Dracula
- **Context-aware layouts**: Use different formats for different directories

## Summary

Your terminal prompt is personal - it should reflect how you work and what information you need at a glance. My Starship configuration has evolved from when I was using PowerLine10k and will continue to be added to as time goes on.

The key is to start with something functional, then iterate. Pay attention to which information you actually use and which just becomes noise. A great prompt should feel invisible when you don't need it and invaluable when you do.
