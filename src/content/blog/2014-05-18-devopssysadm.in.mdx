I had registered the domain [DevOps-SysAdm.in](http://devops-sysadm.in/) with the intention of creating a second Jekyll based site which was going to be a link dump for stuff. Instead I decided to use [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) as that seemed alot less hassle.

So go on, [head over & follow](http://devops-sysadm.in/). Also, you can [submit stuff](http://devops-sysadm.in/submit)
