As you may have noticed, the blog looks different (again). This is because I have moved from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org "Wordpress") back to [Ghost](https://ghost.org "Ghost") using their [GhostPro](http://blog.ghost.org/introducing-ghostpro/ "GhostPro") offering.

One of the things I like about Ghost is the default theme, [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper "Casper"). While I wanted to keep it there were a few things I wanted to tweak, such as removing the full page header image on main index.

When I have previously used Ghost I have forked the theme on GitHub and then manually messed about getting any updates from the original code in.

This time I decided that I should try and make a proper job of it, this would mean;

- Fork the theme as before
- Add the original repo as a remote upstream
- Make my changes and commit away as normal
- Whenever there is an update to “official” version of Casper, fetch the upstream and rebase.

The initial part was easy enough, I forked the code and added the remote upstream;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Git + Rebase 1/3"
 git clone https://github.com/russmckendrick/Casper.git
 git remote add upstream https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper.git
```


This should allow me to run the following commands when there was an update to Casper;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Git + Rebase 2/3"
 git fetch upstream
 git rebase upstream/master
```


I noticed today that there was an update made to the theme so I tried my first rebase;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Git + Rebase 3/3"
 ⚡ git fetch upstream
 From https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper
 1b86190..025fa6e master -> upstream/master
 ⚡ git rebase upstream/master
 First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it…
 Applying: Adding MediaGlasses Custom bits
 Applying: Adding Font Awesome CSS
 Applying: Adding Favicons
 Applying: Changing tags details
 Applying: Adding Twemoji and changing tag prefix
 Applying: Use last post as the header
```


It worked :D. Will be interesting to see what happens when there is a bigger update to the original.
