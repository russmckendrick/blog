It looks like I have written about the tools I use day-to-day since [2017](/2017/01/05/day-to-day-tools/); I wonder how much has changed. 🤔

<InfoCallout title="Info">
As you may already know, I am a [macOS](/tags/macos/) user, so all of the tools covered in this post primarily run on Macs. 🍎
</InfoCallout>

## Desktop Apps 💻

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): This is still my primary IDE; I use it for all of the infrastructure as code I write along with any other code I need to write and debug, and trust me, there is more debugging going on than writing most of the time. 🐛
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): For raw text editing, I use a pretty vanilla version of Sublime Text. 📝 
- [Paste](https://pasteapp.io): I have used Paste for a few years. It's great to have everything I have copied and pasted across my devices in an easy-to-use searchable database—I'm not sure what I would do without it now, as everything is a quick **[CMD]**+**[Shift]**+**V** away. 📋
- [1Password](https://1password.com/): 1Password remains my password manager of choice, and it has been since I started blogging over ten years ago! 🔒 
- [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/): Being a macOS user, I don't get to use what I assume is the "awesomeness" of Visio - luckily, this tool blows it out of the water 😃 🎨
- [Bear Notes](https://bear.app/): Note applications have come and gone, but Bear Notes remains my go-to app. It has a clean interface, powerful markdown support, and seamless syncing across my devices. 🐻📝 
- [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/): This app is perfect for those who need a robust, feature-rich, and Tweetbot-like Mastonden client. Ivory provides a smooth and customizable user experience, making staying connected and engaged on social media easier. 🐘💬
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/): iTerm is my terminal emulator of choice. It offers more features and customization options than the default Terminal app, including split panes, custom color schemes, and extensive keyboard shortcuts. 💻

## Terminal Apps ⌨️ 

- [OpenCommit](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit): this CLI tool uses AI to automatically generate meaningful commit messages for your code changes. It generated the commit messages for this post if you look [here](https://github.com/russmckendrick/blog/commits/main/). 🤖💬
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): Another mainstay of the tools I use, this is the only real package manager for macOS. It simplifies the installation of software and tools, making it easy to keep my development environment up-to-date. 🍺  
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure as code tool that allows me to define and provision cloud resources using a high-level configuration language. I use it both at work and at home and covered in more detail [here](/tags/terraform/) and wrote a book about which you can find [here](https://www.packtpub.com/product/infrastructure-as-code-for-beginners/9781837631636). ☁️🏗️
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is my go-to automation tool for configuration management and application deployment. Its simple, agentless architecture makes it easy to manage and automate tasks across multiple servers. Oh yeah, [I have also just released a book on it as well](https://www.packtpub.com/product/learn-ansible-second-edition/9781835088913). 🤖📚
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) is an open-source package management and environment management system, see [this post](/2024/04/06/conda-for-python-environment-management-on-macos/) for more information. 🐍📦
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is a versatile tool for running and managing large language models (LLMs) locally. It supports various models like Llama 3, Mistral, and others, allowing you to customize and run LLMs efficiently on your machine. I covered this in more detail [here](/2024/03/29/running-llms-locally-with-ollama/). 🦙🧠
