It has been a while since I have posted, since Docker Bootcamp was published I have been hard at work on the second edition of Mastering Docker for [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/) which is now available from [https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/mastering-docker-9781789618686](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/mastering-docker-9781789618686) as well as Amazon and all other book stores.
