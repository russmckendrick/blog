Just a quick post this week, following on from [my last post last week about using Conda](/2024/04/06/conda-for-python-environment-management-on-macos/) and also the one from a few weeks about about [running LLMs locally using ollama](/2024/03/29/running-llms-locally-with-ollama/) I decided to explore the world of AI image generation on my local macOS machine.

To do this I thought I would revisit a tool I dabbled with about a year ago called [InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI), the tool is described as follows:

> InvokeAI is a leading creative engine for Stable Diffusion models, empowering professionals, artists, and enthusiasts to generate and create visual media using the latest AI-driven technologies. The solution offers an industry leading WebUI, supports terminal use through a CLI, and serves as the foundation for multiple commercial products.

## Installing InvokeAI

While there is an automated installer, I thought it best to run through a manual installation so I have a little more control over what is installed and where on my machine.

### Preparing the Python environment

I am going to use Conda so I don't end up messing up my newly organized Python environment:

```text frame="terminal" title="Creating the InvokeAI conda environment"
conda create -n InvokeAI python=3.11
conda activate InvokeAI
```


As you can see, we are setting up the environment using Python 3.11, this is because not everything that InvokeAI uses has been updated to use Python 3.12, yet. 

### Setting the path and installing

With our Python environment ready we can now set the path where InvokeAI will store its config, database and files:

```text frame="terminal" title="Setting the path"
export INVOKEAI_ROOT=~/invokeai
mkdir $INVOKEAI_ROOT
```


The path I have used, `~/invokeai` is the default one, if you change this I would recommend adding `export INVOKEAI_ROOT=~/your/own/path/to/invokeai` to your `~/.zshrc` or [Dotfiles](/2024/04/02/updating-my-dotfiles/).

We can now install InvokeAI itself, to do this run the following command:

```text frame="terminal" title="Installing InvokeAI and its requirements"
pip install InvokeAI --use-pep517 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```


As you can see, it installs **alot** of packages and takes a few minutes to download and install everything.

### Starting the web interface

Once installed, all that is left to do is to start the web interface - to do this run the following command:

```text frame="terminal" title="Starting the InvokeAI web interface"
invokeai-web
```


The first time you run this command it will take slightly longer than it normally would take due to it creating the configuration files and databases etc.

      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/install/02.png" },
    ],
  }}
  options={{
    thumbnail: true,
  }}
/>

As you can see from the output above, once it has started you will prompted to open your browser and entering http://127.0.0.1:9090/.

## Using InvokeAI

Upon first opening the web UI you will be presented with a screen which looks like one below:

### Downloading a model

Before we can generate an image we need to download a model, I chose to download [Juggernaut XL v9](https://civitai.com/models/133005?modelVersionId=348913) which is one of the ones listed in the model manager - as you can see from the samples below, it is capable of quite a few different styles of images:

    imgs: [
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/01.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/02.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/03.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/04.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/05.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/06.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/07.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/08.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/09.png" },
      { src: "/assets/2024-04-14-installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/samples/10.png" },
    ],
  }}
  options={{
    thumbnail: true,
  }}
/>

### Creating the cover image for this post

With the model downloaded, I went to the test prompt page and entered the following as the prompt:

> Photo of a 1950s vintage retro robot working intently on his laptop, seated in a bustling coffee shop. The scene captures a realistic setting with natural lighting from the window, reflecting off his detailed, focused expression. Surrounding him are blurred patrons and baristas, adding depth and life to the image, complemented by the ambient coffee shop interior with wooden tables and cozy decor. Natural light, 35mm photograph, film, professional, 4k, highly detailed, Golden hour lighting, Depth of field F2, Rule of Thirds Composition.

I also entered this as the negative prompt:

> malformed, extra limbs, poorly drawn anatomy, badly drawn, extra legs, low resolution, blurry, Watermark, Text, censored, deformed, bad anatomy, disfigured, poorly drawn face, mutated, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, disconnected head, malformed hands, long neck, mutated hands and fingers, bad hands, missing fingers, cropped, worst quality, low quality, mutation, poorly drawn, huge calf, bad hands, fused hand, missing hand, disappearing arms, disappearing thigh, disappearing calf, disappearing legs, missing fingers, fused fingers, abnormal eye proportion, Abnormal hands, abnormal legs, abnormal feet, abnormal fingers, drawing, painting, crayon, sketch, graphite, impressionist, noisy, blurry, soft, deformed, ugly.

Then I clicked the button to generate the image:

{/* GALLERY: Directory not found: images/web/cover/01.png */}

After a few minutes, and after clicking the upscale button I was left with this:

{/* GALLERY: Directory not found: images/web/cover/02.png */}

It wasn't exactly what I asked for - but as a first effort, not a bad result - you can find the upscaled version [here](/2024/04/14/installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/cover/raw.png).

### Trying again

Let's take the prompts and settings from one of the examples and run that through our own local copy of the model:

> A hyperdetailed photograph of a Cat dressed as a mafia boss holding a fish walking down a Japanese fish market with an angry face, 8k resolution, best quality, beautiful photograph, dynamic lighting,

With a negative prompt of:

> (worst quality, low quality, normal quality, lowres, low details, oversaturated, undersaturated, overexposed, underexposed, grayscale, bw, bad photo, bad photography, bad art:1.4), (watermark, signature, text font, username, error, logo, words, letters, digits, autograph, trademark, name:1.2), (blur, blurry, grainy), morbid, ugly, asymmetrical, mutated malformed, mutilated, poorly lit, bad shadow, draft, cropped, out of frame, cut off, censored, jpeg artifacts, out of focus, glitch, duplicate, (airbrushed, cartoon, anime, semi-realistic, cgi, render, blender, digital art, manga, amateur:1.3), (3D ,3D Game, 3D Game Scene, 3D Character:1.1), (bad hands, bad anatomy, bad body, bad face, bad teeth, bad arms, bad legs, deformities:1.3

Clicking on the Invoke button gives ...

{/* GALLERY: Directory not found: images/web/again/01.png */}

We can soon start to see the image coming together ...

{/* GALLERY: Directory not found: images/web/again/02.png */}

Until we have our final image ...

{/* GALLERY: Directory not found: images/web/again/03.png */}

Not quite sure whats up with the fish - but another great effort ...

{/* GALLERY: Directory not found: images/web/again/04.png */}

You can find the untouched upscaled image [here](/2024/04/14/installing-and-running-invokeai-on-macos/images/web/again/raw.png).

## Shutting down and starting up

When you have finished with InvokeAI you can shut it down by pressing **CTRL+C** to quit. When you need to reopen, open a terminal and run:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Starting InvokeAI up again"
conda activate InvokeAI
invokeai-web
```


Returning to http://127.0.0.1:9090/ will let you pick up where you left off.
