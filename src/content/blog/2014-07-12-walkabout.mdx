I have been missing in action for a while, busy with work and other “stuff”. Since I last posted …..

- [Docker 1.0 has been released.](http://blog.docker.com/2014/06/its-here-docker-1-0/)
- [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)[7 has been released](http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2014-July/020393.html).
- I have updated the sites theme again to use [So Simple](http://mademistakes.com/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme/).
- [Aphex Twin’s Long Lost Caustic Window LP was released.](http://pitchfork.com/news/55596-stream-aphex-twins-long-lost-caustic-window-lp/)
- Also new albums from [Neil Finn](http://neilfinn.com/albums/solo/?album=3532), [Anathema](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/anathema-exclusive-album-stream-get-a-first-listen-to-the-bands-new-record-distant-satellites-9487235.html?dkdk) and [Crippled Black Phoenix](https://riseupandfight.bandcamp.com) have all been released.
- I have written a [blog post for work](http://www.reconnix.com/2014/07/07/multi-factor-authentication-in-aws/) on MFA in AWS.

….. suppose I had better make more of an effort to post now that everything has caught up.
