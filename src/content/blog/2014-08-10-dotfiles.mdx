For the last few years I have been grabbing some we [documented dotfiles from GitHub](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=dotfiles&ref=cmdform&s=stars&type=Repositories) but most of them have either ended up reconfigured my Mac to the point of it being unrecognisable or they have just been a collection of useful aliases. The I came across [Bashstrap](https://github.com/barryclark/bashstrap), it was close enough to what I wanted so I [forked it](https://github.com/russmckendrick/dotfiles) ….

You can install them using the following commands;

```bash frame="terminal" title="Dotfiles 1/1"
git clone git@github.com:russmckendrick/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
sudo easy_install Pygments
brew install tree
mv ~/.bash_profile ~/.dotfiles/backups/
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.dotfiles/backups/
mv ~/.gitconfig ~/.dotfiles/backups/
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.hushlogin ~/.hushlogin
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/z.sh ~/.z.sh
```


Once installed you can do stuff like;

- s . or s filename.txt will open your current directory or a file in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
- m README.md will open the specified file in [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com/)
- Jump directories rapidly, without having to set aliases using [Z](https://github.com/rupa/z)
- Syntax highlighted ‘cat’

amongst other things;
