Its been quite a while since I wrote up what I am using on day to day, in fact I seem to have skipped all of 2016.

#### Desktop Apps

Not too much change on the Desktop …

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/); I started off the year Atom, but this gives me the same functionality and seems quicker
- [Pastebot](https://tapbots.com/pastebot/); Working in tech means I copy and paste alot, this lets me sync and (not all from [StackOverflow](https://www.christianheilmann.com/2015/07/17/the-full-stackoverflow-developer/))
- [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com); For note taking

… still using [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com) (Still the best text editor around), [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html), [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle), [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) & [MS Office](https://www.office.com).

#### Command line

There have been a few additions …

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/); Enough said really
- [HTTPie](https://httpie.org); Great for testing web based “stuff”
- [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com); Seems to have got me out of alot of scrapes and save me alot of time this year
- [Hostess](https://github.com/cbednarski/hostess); Because I am lazy and want to use a tool to manage my hosts file
- [mas-cli](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas); To script Mac App Store installations after rebuilds

… as well as still using [Home Brew](http://brew.sh), [Cask](http://caskroom.io/), [StormSSH](https://github.com/emre/storm), [known_hosts](https://github.com/markmcconachie/known_hosts) & [Z](https://github.com/rupa/z)

#### Services

Finally, using the following services …

- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=52ec4dc3647e), for spinning up test instances
- [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com); Using Route53 as well as spinning up test instances
- [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/); Great for demoing stuff
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/); With all of the writting I am doing I found this useful

… along with [Github](https://github.com/russmckendrick), [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/), [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) and [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) .

Here are what I was using in 2015, 2014 and 2013;
