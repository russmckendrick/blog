Since [my last post about Docker](/2014/04/27/deploying-a-stable-docker-setup-on-centos-with-shipyard/) I have been playing a lot more, rather than use a GUI like [Shipyard](http://shipyard-project.com/) I decided to use @garethr’s [excellent Puppet Module](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/docker) to manage and deploy my containers. This allowed me to take a better look at the builds I had over at the [Docker Index](https://index.docker.io/). The following is a list of builds I have deployed so far …..

#### General Containers

- [Base](https://github.com/russmckendrick/docker/pkgs/container/base) — Base build for use with other Docker build
- <del>Jump Host</del>- Build which can be used as a SSH jump host

#### Database Containers

- <del>MySQL 5.5</del> — Build which runs MySQL 5.5
- <del>MySQL 5.6</del> — Build which runs MySQL 5.6

#### PHP Containers

- <del>Apache & PHP 5.4</del> — Build which runs Apache with PHP 5.4
- <del>Apache & PHP 5.5</del> — Build which runs Apache with PHP 5.5
- <del>NGINX & PHP 5.4</del> — Build which runs NGINX with PHP 5.4 & PHP-FPM
- <del>NGINX & PHP 5.5</del> — Build which runs NGINX with PHP 5.5 & PHP-FPM

See the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/russmckendrick/docker) and my [Docker Index Profile](https://index.docker.io/u/russmckendrick/) for more information.
