It has just dawned on me, I have been using the "Aqua Blue" variation of wallpapers which stated shiping with MacOS X since I got my first iMac G3 in 2001.

There have been a few variations of it, however the one I have settled on is the one with came with MacOS X 10.4 Tiger. It has been the first thing I have installed on every Mac, Linux and even Windows machine I have run since 2005.

I am not sure what having the same desktop wallpaper for the last 14 years says about me
