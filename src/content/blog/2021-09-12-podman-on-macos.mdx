Last weekend I posted about [Docker Desktop Alternatives for macOS](/2021/09/05/docker-desktop-alternatives-for-macos/), and it looks like I missed one as the week before [Podman](https://podman.io/) release version [v3.3.0](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases) which introduced support for macOS by allowing you to launch a Podman managed virtual machine.

So, What is Podman?

> Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System. Containers can either be run as root or in rootless mode. 

As it has been built to run and manage OCI compliant container images it means that any images want to run built using any other Container engine, like [Docker](/tags/docker/) or [containerd](https://containerd.io) (which was covered in last weeks post using Lima) will also "just" work with Podman - to the point where the Podman developers are confident enough to claim that you add `alias docker=podman` on your machine as running Podman is nearly indistinguishable from running Docker.

Let's put that to the test.

## Installing Podman

As I am running macOS installing Podman using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is just a simple command:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Install Podman"
``` awk
brew install podman
```
```


## Using Podman Machine

Once the `podman` client binaries are installed there isn't much you can do with it other than connect to remote instances of Podman, this is because macOS is not able to natively run containers so we need to download a Linux image to run a virtual machine, to do this simply run the following command:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Download the image"
``` awk
podman machine init
```
```


As you can see from the following output this downloads a custom Fedora image based on CoreOS:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Output"
``` plaintext
Downloading VM image: fedora-coreos-34.20210904.1.0-qemu.x86_64.qcow2.xz: done
Extracting compressed file
```
```


Now that we have a copy of the image and the virtual machine has been created, we can now start the virtual machine by running:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Start the machine"
``` awk
podman machine start
```
```


This gives the following output, as you can see, there is a warning - but this release is hot off the press so we can forgive that:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Output"
``` plaintext
INFO[0000] waiting for clients...
INFO[0000] listening tcp://0.0.0.0:7777
Waiting for VM ...
INFO[0000] new connection from  to /var/folders/q8/dplpdx9n7lz1r3m282_vcz440000gn/T/podman/qemu_podman-machine-default.sock
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.svm [bit 2]
```
```


Once the virtual machine is up and running you can run the following command to open a shell to it:

```bash frame="terminal" title="SSH to the machine"
``` awk
podman machine ssh
```
```


Now we have a shell on the machine lets look at the operating system information:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Output"
``` plaintext

While you can open a shell to the machine it is not needed to run so let's run some containers using the `podman` client on our Mac.

## Using Podman

So now we have everything up and running let's re-run the same command we used when [testing Lima in the last post](/2021/09/05/docker-desktop-alternatives-for-macos/#lima).

### Hello World!!!

First up is the `podman` equivalent of running `docker container run hello-world`, as we have already stated that you can simply replace Docker with Podman it will be no surprise that the command is:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Podman Hello World"
``` awk
podman container run hello-world
```
```


As expected, this connects straight do the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world), pulls and then runs the image:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Output"
``` plaintext
Resolved "hello-world" as an alias (/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/000-shortnames.conf)
Trying to pull docker.io/library/hello-world:latest...

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```
```


So far, so good.

### Building and running an Image

Next, lets take the Dockerfile we built last time and try building it using Podman, as a reminder the Dockerfile looks like the following:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Build the image"
``` dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
LABEL maintainer="Russ McKendrick <russ@mckendrick.io>"
LABEL description="This example Dockerfile installs NGINX."
RUN apk add --update nginx && \
        rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* && \
        mkdir -p /tmp/nginx/

COPY files/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY files/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
ADD files/html.tar.gz /usr/share/nginx/

EXPOSE 80/tcp

ENTRYPOINT ["nginx"]
CMD ["-g", "daemon off;"]
```
```


To build the image you will [need to checkout this repo](https://github.com/russmckendrick/lima-dockerfile-example) and run the build command from the folder containing the `Dockerfile`. The command to build and tag the image is no different to the one which we would use in Docker:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Build the image"
``` awk
podman image build --tag local:podman-example .
```
```


The output of the build is below:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Output"
``` plaintext

88a4d1cbc6dcf92cd4662da990e80125ad062c0ac99551e38c0a2e8eee9231f9
```
```


Once built you can use the following command to run the image:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Running the image"
``` awk
podman container run -d --name podman-example -p 8080:80 --network bridge local:podman-example
```
```


Once running, open a browser and goto **http://localhost:8080/** and you should be greeted by:

<Img src="/assets/2021-09-12-podman-on-macos/images/01.png" alt="You know the rules and so do I" />

<InfoCallout title="Info">
Now the keen eyed amongst you may have noticed that the command to launch the container is a little slightly different than want we used in the last post, at the time of writing *--network bridge* is needed to map port **8080** from the virtual machine to **127.0.0.1** on the mac. The next release which is due in the next fortnight should resolve this.
</InfoCallout>

<InfoCallout title="Info">
**Update 10/10/2021** the update has been release and it works as expected, so you can remove the *--network bridge* from the command.
</InfoCallout>

### Other commands

From as you can see from the terminals below, other commands you would just run in Docker to manage your containers just work:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Listing the images"
``` plaintext
podman image ls
REPOSITORY                     TAG             IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE

```


```bash frame="terminal" title="Listing all the containers"
``` plaintext
podman container ls -a

```


```bash frame="terminal" title="Removing a container"
``` plaintext
podman container rm podman-example
```
```


```bash frame="terminal" title="Pruning the containers"
``` plaintext
podman container prune
WARNING! This will remove all non running containers.

79e3825f608e5f4a0ce8dd03849ecb55d5ff03eeff063a52c9e053bcde0460fc
```
```


```bash frame="terminal" title="Pruning the images"
``` plaintext
podman image prune
WARNING! This will remove all dangling images.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
```
```


## Tidying up Podman

Once you have finished having a play with Podman you will need to stop the virtual machine, as you may have already guessed, to do this run the following command:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Stopping the machine"
``` awk
podman machine stop
```
```


Once stopped, you can start it back up again - order to remove the Virtual Machine altogether run:

```bash frame="terminal" title="Stopping the machine"
``` awk
podman machine rm
```
```


This will give the following prompt:

<WarningCallout title="Warning">
This will delete the virtual machine and everything on it, please make sure you really to do this before agreeing.
</WarningCallout>

```bash frame="terminal" title="Output"
``` plaintext
The following files will be deleted:

/Users/russ.mckendrick/.ssh/podman-machine-default
/Users/russ.mckendrick/.ssh/podman-machine-default.pub
/Users/russ.mckendrick/.config/containers/podman/machine/qemu/podman-machine-default.ign
/Users/russ.mckendrick/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/qemu/podman-machine-default_fedora-coreos-34.20210904.1.0-qemu.x86_64.qcow2
/Users/russ.mckendrick/.config/containers/podman/machine/qemu/podman-machine-default.json


Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]
```
```


Once you have delete the virtual machine you will need to run `podman machine init` to recreate it again.

## Bonus Desktop App 

While currently there is not an official native Desktop app for Podman on macOS, Victor Gama has coded and released one which can be downloaded from [heyvito/podman-macos](https://github.com/heyvito/podman-macos), the screens below show the application in action ...

<Img src="/assets/2021-09-12-podman-on-macos/images/02.png" alt="Installing" />
<Img src="/assets/2021-09-12-podman-on-macos/images/03.png" alt="Welcome to Podman" />
<Img src="/assets/2021-09-12-podman-on-macos/images/04.png" alt="Preparing ..." />

<Img src="/assets/2021-09-12-podman-on-macos/images/06.png" alt="Checking out running containers" />
<Img src="/assets/2021-09-12-podman-on-macos/images/07.png" alt="Interacting with running containers" />

... at the time of writing of writing the application is less than a week or so old so I recommend keeping an eye on the repo for updates.

## Summary

Podman has long been used on Linux machines, and the developers (RedHat) have been working on the macOS integration long before Docker announced their changes to the licensing model for Docker Desktop.

There are however some bugs, like the one mentioned, and also some functionality which needs to be in place - the biggest of which is the at the time of writing there is no native way to mount the filesystem from the host (macOS) into the virtual machine (Podman) which could be a deal breaker from some developers as this could block them from easily developing locally. However, the good thing is the Podman developers know all of this and are working hard to add the functionality on top of their already solid base.
