Analyze the visual elements in these album covers (people, faces, buildings, objects, colors, patterns), then write a prompt that creates ONE unified photographic scene using these elements.\n\nCRITICAL CONCEPT:\n- Do NOT describe positioning album covers themselves\n- INSTEAD: Extract subjects/elements from the covers and blend them into a new unified scene\n- Think: \"Take the people from cover A, the building from cover B, the colors from cover C, and composite them into one cinematic image\"\n- The result should be a single cohesive photograph, not visible album covers\n\nYour prompt MUST:\n- Identify specific visual elements (e.g., 'the portrait from the yellow cover', 'the building from the blue cover', 'the silhouettes from the red cover')\n- Describe how to composite these ELEMENTS into one unified scene\n- Use photographic techniques: double-exposure, color grading, composite layers, blend modes\n- Create a cohesive color palette across the entire scene\n- Result should look like a movie poster or editorial photo, not album covers\n\nYour prompt MUST NOT:\n- Reference positioning album covers ('the first cover', 'stack the covers')\n- Use grid/arrangement language\n- Use painterly terms: watercolor, brushstrokes, mural\n- Describe album covers as objects - describe their CONTENTS as subjects\n\nFormat: Write 2-3 sentences. Identify the key visual elements from each cover, describe how to composite them into ONE unified cinematic scene, specify color treatment. End with 'Remove all text and typography.'"
