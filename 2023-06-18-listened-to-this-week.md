With an impressive 42 top 30 singles to their name, including a whopping 22 top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart, the Pet Shop Boys have undoubtedly solidified their place in music history. 📈💿 So, if you haven't yet explored their discography, I highly recommend immersing yourself in their infectious beats and catchy lyrics.
