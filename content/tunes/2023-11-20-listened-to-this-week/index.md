## 🎵 Keeping Beat to my Tune: my Music Playlist this Week 🎶

Hello, music enthusiasts from all across the globe! 🌍

It has been a hodgepodge of sounds and melodies accompanying me this week, with a note of nostalgia featuring quite prominently. From guitar riffs to enchanting vocals and psychedelic rock, my eardrums have been rocking for seven consecutive days. I can't say I am complaining, though! 😉 

Thanks to [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick), I have been able to trace my musical journey and enjoyed reliving it. In a surprising turn of events, the biggest stalwarts of English music, the Fab Four otherwise known as The Beatles 🍏, emerged as my most played artists of the week! 

### Spotlight Artist: The Beatles 🍏

Every now and then, I feel compelled to loop back to the basics, to the music that compromises the core of rock and roll: The Beatles. This timeless band has proven once again that "Love is All You Need." From immortal anthems like "Here Comes The Sun" 🌞and "Let It Be," to groovy hits like "Yellow Submarine," the magic of the Beatles has been dominating my playlist this week.

Their famously groundbreaking guitar work and profound lyrics about nothing less than life and love evoke a sense of nostalgia for a time I never lived in, paradoxically refreshing my mind, heart, and soul. It's safe to say my liking for The Beatles has "Come Together" this week.

### The Vibrant Ensemble🎶

Alongside The Beatles, my playlist did not shy away from entertaining a host of iconic talents:

**David Bowie** 🌠 and his otherworldly, glam rock beats with "Life on Mars?" made me feel like I was floating in a Tin Machine somewhere in space. The sheer individuality and cosmic charm of his songs astrally launched me into a different dimension entirely.

**Richard Hawley's** soothing, melancholic tunes provided a gentle contrast. "Tonight The Streets Are Ours" is something I am particularly fond of - a song that manages to capture the essence of a night town, transfixed in its narratives and tunes.

**Radiohead**, the master storytellers of alternative rock, accompanied me on some introspective nights. "Karma Police" and "Creep" were frequently played, and I must admit, there’s something about Yorke’s haunting vocals that never fail to captivate me.

Who could forget the funky **Talking Heads**? Their innovative sound mixing elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music have invigorated many an evening this week. “Once in a Lifetime” and "Psycho Killer" provided the perfect vibes for some adventure.

In terms of humor and whimsicality, none can top **Weezer**. Their sound, a mix of heavy guitars and catchy pop, is distinct and hard to forget. "Island In The Sun" was my pick most mornings.

As for my guilty pleasure? **John Farnham**. Despite being known mainly in the Australian circuit, his powerful and emotive ballads stirred emotions in me that I never knew existed. "You're the Voice" has an inspiring tone, reminding me of the power of music.

Paying tribute to great rock n rollers, I turned to **R.E.M**, **Van Halen**, and **Genesis**. Their generational anthems hitched me on a wild musical ride. I must admit the guitar prowess demonstrated by Van Halen in "Jump" was electrifying.

Adding some hip hop spice into the mix, **Beastie Boys** had me bobbing my head and tapping my foot along their witty and innovative soundscape. Their inclusivity of jazz-infused sounds in classic hip hop beats on 'Sabotage' kept my playlist diverse and eclectic.

Lastly, a special nod to **Matt Berry**, his fresh experimental tunes and baritone vocals truly are a joy to listen to. Pieces like "October Sun" gave my evenings a warm, soothing glow.

Before we wrap up, do note that this post has been jam crafted by my AI assistant, pulling together data and music insights from my life. Isn't technology cool? 👨‍💻

It's been another fantastic week of enjoying classics, reminiscing, deciphering, and getting lost in music. Here's to another week of you finding the rhythm of your own beat 🎵
