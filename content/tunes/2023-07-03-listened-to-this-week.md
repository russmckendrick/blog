Hey everyone! Welcome back to my blog. This week, I thought I'd share with you the awesome music that has been filling my ears and lifting my spirits. 🎶😄

Before diving into the playlist, let me start by mentioning that the most played artist on my list this week was Prefab Sprout. Now, I must admit, I was quite late to discover them, but boy, am I glad I did! Prefab Sprout is an English pop band that rose to fame during the amazing 1980s. It all started back in 1978 when brothers Paddy and Martin McAloon formed the band, later joined by the incredibly talented Wendy Smith in 1982. Their debut album, "Swoon," was released in 1984 and received critical acclaim. 🌟

According to Paul Lester of The Guardian, their subsequent albums, including the iconic "Steve McQueen" in 1985 and the brilliant "Jordan: The Comeback" in 1990, are "some of the most beautiful and intelligent records of [insert time period here]." It's safe to say that I've fallen head over heels for Paddy McAloon's soulful voice and the band's infectious melodies. If you haven't checked out their music yet, do yourself a favor and take a dive into their discography. You won't be disappointed! 🎵

Now, moving on to the other artists who've accompanied me throughout the week. There's nothing quite like the powerful, grungy tunes of Stone Temple Pilots to get your blood pumping. With hits like "Plush" and "Interstate Love Song," they never fail to bring the '90s nostalgia rushing back. 🤘

Airhead, the British electronic music producer, also found his way onto my playlist this week. His mesmerizing beats and dreamy compositions always transport me to another dimension. It's the perfect soundtrack when I need to relax and unwind after a long day. ✨

Speaking of '90s nostalgia, who could forget the iconic Hootie & The Blowfish? Their catchy tunes like "Only Wanna Be with You" and "Hold My Hand" bring waves of memories crashing back, reminding me of summer road trips and carefree days. 🚗🌞

Anathema, the legendary British rock band known for their atmospheric soundscapes and emotionally charged lyrics, made their presence felt as well. Their song "Fragile Dreams" hits me right in the feels every time, with its hauntingly beautiful melody and heartfelt vocals. 🌌

Pearl Jam, the kings of grunge, brought their signature Seattle sound to my playlist. Eddie Vedder's raw vocals and the band's soul-stirring instrumentals come together in songs like "Black" and "Alive," creating an intense and cathartic musical experience. 🎸

Portishead, the trip-hop pioneers, found their way onto my favorite list this week as well. Their unique blend of haunting electronics and Beth Gibbons' ethereal vocals never fails to captivate me. "Glory Box" and "Sour Times" are just a taste of their enchanting repertoire. 🌫️

Jane's Addiction, the alternative rock legends, rocked my world with their energetic and unpredictable sound. Perry Farrell's dynamic vocals and songs like "Been Caught Stealing" and "Jane Says" are a perfect blend of grit and soul. 🎤🎶

Moving on to one of the most iconic bands of all time, U2 takes their place on my playlist with pride. These Irish rockers have consistently delivered anthems that resonate with millions, from the uplifting "Beautiful Day" to the introspective "With or Without You." Their music never fails to stir up emotions within me. 🌈

The Style Council, the English band formed by none other than Paul Weller, enchanted me with their smooth and sophisticated sound. Perfect for easy Sunday mornings or late-night drives, their songs like "Shout to the Top!" and "Long Hot Summer" are timeless classics. 🔥

Now, let's take a moment to appreciate the prog-rock legends, Genesis. From their early days with Peter Gabriel to the Phil Collins era, their music is a journey through time and genre. Whether it's the theatrical "Supper's Ready" or the radio-friendly "Invisible Touch," Genesis has a song for every mood. 🎭

Last but not least, let's get funky with Fishbone! This American rock band infused ska, punk, and funk into their music, creating a truly unique and energetic sound. "Everyday Sunshine" and "Party at Ground Zero" are guaranteed to get you grooving and smiling from ear to ear. 🎺🕺

So, there you have it, folks! These are just a few of the artists that have accompanied me throughout the week. If you want to explore more of what I've been listening to, feel free to check out my Last.fm profile at [Last.fm Profile](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick). 👀
