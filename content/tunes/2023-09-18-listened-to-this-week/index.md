# 🎵 My Weekly Music Recap: An Indie-Rock Emotional Rollercoaster 🤘

Hi all, hope you're having a melodically enriched week just like me! I've been on a bit of an indie rock drenched rollercoaster this last week, and it wouldn't be fair if I didn't share it with you all. So, here's a rundown of what's been on my headphones. So grab a cup of ☕, put on some 🎧, and join me on this wild sonic adventure.

### Doves: Taking me to Cloud Number Nine 🌥🚀

Music somehow always seems to take the front seat when it comes to emotions, and this week I've been awash in the mellow waves of Doves 🕊. For those who aren't familiar with Doves, they're an English indie rock band from Manchester that rocked the charts between 2000 and 2020.

The trio of twin brothers, Jez and Andy Williams, playing the guitar and drums along with vocals, and Jimi Goodwin handling the lead vocals, bass, and guitar crafted a distinct sound that never fails to pluck at my heartstrings. Martin Rebelski added a unique touch to their live performances with his skill on the keyboards.

The replay button has been invariably stuck 🔁 on [The Places Between: The Best of Doves](https://open.spotify.com/album/15St67wo5Ef25WflP2krib), a compilation album that was released in April 2. It's honestly been quite the ride – I'm finding it hard to put in words how their music makes me feel.

Let's just say, Doves have certainly provided an ethereal soundtrack to my week, and I'm super glad I hit upon their harmonious tunes on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick).

### Riding the Melodious Waves 🎶

Apart from Doves, my ears were lucky to feast upon the artistry of The Smiths, The Smashing Pumpkins, Prince, Tom Waits, Held By Trees, Talk Talk, Oceansize, and Suede. Each artist, with their unique style and unmatched talent, brought a different flavor to my audiosphere, keeping me absorbed and engaged.

Aggregate these all, and what you get is an indie-rock cocktail shaken well with a dash of glorious pop, a shot of potent alternative rock, mellowed down with some indie-pop, with a slice of soulful R&B on the side. 🍸🎸

Every note, every beat, every melody enhanced and enriched my week, painting a colorful sonic tapestry that is hard to ignore.

### Wrapping Up: Harmony in Chaos 🎼

Music, with its wide array of tunes, melodies and rhythms, somehow always narrates my week better than I ever can. This week has been a whirlwind of emotions, perfectly complemented by the array of artists I've been tuning into. Doves, with their ethereal compositions, were indeed the crescendo to it all.

P.S: Don't forget to check out my Last.fm profile [here](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick), where I constantly update what I'm listening to and discover new artists. 🎵

See you on the flip side my audiophiles! 🤘
