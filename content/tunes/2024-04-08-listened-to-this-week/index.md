## ðŸŽ¶ Tuning into My Week with Dr. Feelgood & More! ðŸŽ¶

Hey music lovers and rhythm finders! ðŸ‘‹

If thereâ€™s one thing consistent in my life, itâ€™s the beats, riffs, and lyrics that flood through my headphones every week. So, I thought, why not dive into a little recap? You know, share the sound waves that have been filling my space. And who knows, you might just find your next favorite jam or a throwback to spin on repeat! ðŸ”„

### **Good Olâ€™ Dr. Feelgood**

My most played artist this week was none other than the pub rock band **Dr. Feelgood**. These guys take the cake â€” or should I say, the microphone? ðŸŽ¤ Whether it was cranking out chores or just needing some feel-good vibes, they were my go-to. Their raw, gritty sound is like a time machine straight back to the â€˜70s rock scene. And their name doesn't lie; their tunes seriously upped my mood every time I hit play.

### **A Blend of Old and New**

But it hasn't been just Dr. Feelgood on my playlist rotation. Iâ€™ve been all over the musical map this week, from alternative rock to post-punk revival. Hereâ€™s a rundown of other artists that kept me company:

- **Manic Street Preachers**: Their charged anthems are great for when I need to feel like I can take on the world.
- **The Police**: Every time I listen to them, I'm reminded why they're classics. Stingâ€™s voice? Timeless.
- **Del Amitri**: They bring that perfect mix of melancholy and catchy melodies. Great for rainier days.
- **Stephen Malkmus**: Indie rock with a twangy edge that keeps things interesting.
- **Dodgy**: With them, it's like the '90s never ended, in the most comforting way possible.
- **INXS**: They add a dash of pop rock that never fails to make me nod in rhythm.
- **Levellers**: Channeling that folk-punk energy, they're ideal for when I'm feeling a touch rebellious.
- **The Smashing Pumpkins**: Dreamy, gritty, deepâ€”Billy Corgan and the gang always serve complexity.
- **Jane's Addiction**: They provide that raw, unfiltered sound that makes any day better.
- **Tears for Fears**: Their synth-pop is like a warm blanket of nostalgia.
- **The Who**: I mean, do I need to explain? They're called "The Who" for a reason. Icons.
  
### **From Playlists to You**

Now, Iâ€™m curious, what have you been listening to? Are any of these artists in your current rotation? Iâ€™d love to hear about your musical week, whether it's something new youâ€™ve discovered or a good old classic that keeps finding its way back to you. Drop a comment, and let's get a conversation going!

### **Behind the Scenes**

By the way, part of this post was written with a little help from AI. Thatâ€™s right! While my musical taste is 100% human-curated, sometimes we get by with a little help from our AI friends. Who knows? Maybe one day weâ€™ll have robot DJs crafting the perfect playlists... (or do we already? ðŸ˜®) 

Also, shout out to Last.fm for keeping tabs on my tunes. You can stalk my musical fingerprints over at [my Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick). Go ahead and take a look; maybe there's some sync-up in our musical heartbeats!

### **Wrap Up and Jam On**

Alright, team tune, thatâ€™s a wrap on what's been jingling in my ears this week. Itâ€™s been a wild ride of genres and decades â€” just how I like it. Keep your playlists dynamic, your volume at a reasonable level (for ear health, y'know), and let's keep sharing the sounds that make our worlds go round. 

Until next time, keep the tunes cranked, the bass thumping, and the melodies flowing. Peace out and jam on! ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤˜
