Released on November 11, 1991, *We Can't Dance* arrived as the fourteenth studio album by Genesis. It was unveiled to the public by Virgin Records in the UK and Atlantic Records in the US.

### 📈 Reception and Legacy
*We Can't Dance* was well-received commercially and critically, securing its place in the charts and in the hearts of fans. It showcased Genesis’s ability to evolve with the times, all while staying true to the complex compositions that had initially defined them. The album's success also underscored the end of an era, as it was the last to feature the classic trio lineup of Collins, Banks, and Rutherford.

### 🎤 Live Performances and Tours
Following the album's release, Genesis embarked on a massive world tour, which became one of the most memorable tours in their career. The live performances were highly acclaimed, featuring elaborate stage designs and engaging setlists that included both new tracks and classic hits.
