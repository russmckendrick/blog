Released on 17 June 1985, 'Crush' is the sixth studio album by the English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). Known for their distinctive blend of New Wave and Synthpop, OMD, with 'Crush', ventured into a territory that combined their experimental essence with a more polished, commercial sound, particularly aiming to captivate the US market.

### **Band Line-Up**
The album showcases the creative prowess of the founding members, Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), accompanied by Martin Cooper (keyboards, saxophone) and Stuart Kershaw (drums). Throughout their career, OMD has been celebrated for their innovative approach to electronic music, and 'Crush' is no exception, though it marks a notable shift in their musical direction.

### **Production and Sound**
'Crush' was the first of two OMD albums produced by Stephen Hague, who played a significant role in steering the band towards a sound that was both accessible and sophisticated. This album, while still retaining elements of the band’s earlier experimental sounds, clearly aimed to appeal to a broader audience, with its cleaner, more refined production techniques.

### **Track Highlights and Themes**
The album is infused with emotionally charged lyrics and synth-driven melodies that explore themes of love, despair, and human relationships. One of the standout tracks, "So in Love," is a perfect exemplar of this, combining catchy melodies with deep, introspective lyrics. Other notable tracks include "Secret" and "Bloc Bloc Bloc," which further showcase the band's ability to blend catchy pop sensibilities with thought-provoking lyrics.

### **Reception and Legacy**
Upon its release, 'Crush' received mixed reviews from critics. Some appreciated the band's new pop-oriented approach, while others missed the more avant-garde elements typical of their earlier work. Despite the divided critical reception, the album performed well commercially, especially in the United States, helping to broaden OMD's fan base.

### **Interesting Trivia**
- 'Crush' was specifically crafted with the American audience in mind, a strategic move by the band and their production team to increase their market presence across the Atlantic.
