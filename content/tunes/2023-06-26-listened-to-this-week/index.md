# üéµRuss Mckendrick's Weekly Music Breakdownüéµ

Hey there, music aficionados! üéß As with every week, we're diving deep into my musical landscapes, shedding light on the eclectic mix of sounds that have resonated through my speakers and headphones this week.

This data, meticulously compiled from my Last.fm profile (give it a follow if you haven't: https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick, is served fresh with no repeats, guaranteeing a blend of old favorites and new discoveries. Enjoy the journey! 

Hauntingly serving as my sonic backdrop for this week has been none other than George Harrison.üòé‚úåÔ∏è Yes, you heard that right, the magical mystery man from The Beatles! Harrison, known not just for his innovative guitar work but also for his profound songwriting skill, has occupied the top spot on my playlist.

His genius at blending rock, pop and Eastern mysticism is captivating in its tracks like "My Sweet Lord," where his sitar playing strikes a deep chord. Then there's the emotionally rich "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," with its poignant lyrics and heart-rending melody. George Harrison's refreshing perspective on life, love, and spirituality has been providing a rich backdrop to my week.

Switching gears from Harrison's eastern-tinged guitar vibes, I've also been indulging in The Style Council's funky and soulful rhythms. üé∑Their song, "Shout to the Top!" is an underrated 80s gem that has had me grooving in my living room.

Talk about an 80s vibe, let's not forget the post-punk ecstasy in the form of New Order. Blending rock with electronica, their song "Blue Monday" will make you feel anything but blue.

When it comes to making the sonic cosmos echo, nothing compares to Pink Floyd. The surreal journey offered by "Comfortably Numb" or the thought-provoking commentary of "Another Brick in the Wall" has been pouring out of my headphones this week.

Moving a bit more into the rock lane, I've been enjoying Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers' classic hits such as "Free Fallin'" and "I Won't Back Down". They have added nicely to my playlist with their heartland rock.

Adding some icing to the cake, or should I say, Cake? This band was right at home in the midweeks, with their alternative rock prowess loud in tracks like "Short Skirt/Long Jacket".

The indie rush of Delays was also present in my playlist, combined with the ever-dazzling Kate Bush. From her haunting "Wuthering Heights" to the emotionally packed "This Woman's Work," Bush alone can turn a mundane day into a cinematic experience.

And what's a week without a dose of Depeche Mode? The synth-pop masters have been serving their gooey, addictive recipe of electronic bliss.

I've also been travelling back to the 80s with Simple Minds and Tears for Fears, spinning up a storm with "Don't You (Forget About Me)" and "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" respectively.

Last but not least, The Smashing Pumpkins' alternative rock anthems like "1979" have been rounding off my week with a blast.

Surprise, surprise! ü•≥ This week's blog post added a new flair. It was AI generated. Mind blown, right? With AI at the help, let's just say creativity knows no bounds.

Well, that wraps up my rollercoaster ride through the euphoric highs and soothing lows of this week. üé¢ Tune in again next week. Who knows what the playlist will unveil! Until then, keep your heads high and the music loud! üé∂
