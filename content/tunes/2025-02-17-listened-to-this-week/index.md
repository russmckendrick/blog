The album is primarily composed of instrumental music sourced from recordings made during the sessions for The Division Bell (1994). In fact, it was conceived as a tribute to the late Richard Wright, the band’s keyboardist, who passed away in 2008. Producer David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason collaborated closely, piecing together what would become this contemplative sonic voyage.

The creative process was humble and collaborative; old recordings were revisited, and together they decided to build a seamless musical landscape filled with ethereal sounds and improvisations.

In the bustling modern musical landscape, The Endless River serves as a reminder that instrumental music can evoke emotions just as powerfully as lyrical content.

### Legacy and Influence 🏆
As a posthumous tribute to Wright, The Endless River captures not just the essence of Pink Floyd but also highlights the beauty of friendship and musical collaboration.
