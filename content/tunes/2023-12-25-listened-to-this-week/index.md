# üéµ What's Spinning on My Turntable This Week? üéµ

Hello, fellow music lovers! üôå It's your favorite audiophile back at it with another weekly round-up of the tunes that have been fueling my days and nights. There's nothing like discovering new oldies, rekindling love affairs with forgotten tracks, or simply letting a familiar album spin as the perfect backdrop to our lives. So what's been echoing through the halls of my soul this week? Well, my Last.fm profile lets the cat out of the bag, but let's dive in for the uninitiated!

## Exploring The Stars With David Bowie ‚ö°

This week's MVP (Most Valuable Play, that is) goes to none other than the Starman himself - **David Bowie**. Bowie's repertoire is like a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds, each album a different shade, each song a twist of the tube revealing new patterns.

"Ziggy Stardust" is an anthem that never fades, its guitar riffs rocketing through space and time to land squarely in the "still awesome" category every listen. I've also been revisiting "Heroes" on repeat, maybe a bit clich√©, but come on, who doesn't feel ten feet taller walking down the street with that tune in their ears?

üë®‚Äçüé§ "Ashes to Ashes," "Life on Mars?," and "Blackstar" all made frequent appearances this week as I dove into Bowie's ocean of creativity. Each listen is a reminder of why he's an icon - not just of music, but of artistry and the human capacity to reinvent and express.

Now, how about some honorable mentions, eh?

## A Week Of Wonders - From Post-Punk to Baroque Pop

It's been an eclectic mix, with each artist bringing something unique to the turntable.

**The Divine Comedy** has swept me up with their orchestral pop - Neil Hannon has a way of spinning tales that match wit with musical intricacy. "National Express" has been my go-to upbeat track for those moments when I'm striding down the street pretending I'm in a quirky British film.

Then there's **The Stranglers** - their gritty, keyboard-tinged punk always shakes things up a bit. "Golden Brown" has that haunting, timeless melody while "No More Heroes" gets the blood pumping.

Ah, and we cannot forget **Pearl Jam** - Eddie Vedder's voice is the aural equivalent of a weathered, comforting leather jacket. "Black" and "Alive" are just two mainstays that remind me why '90s grunge has left its indelible mark on music.

**The Sisters of Mercy** brought the gothic rock vibes with "Temple of Love" and "This Corrosion." Their sound is like diving into a dark novel where the characters are mysterious and the setting is always midnight.

A twist of nostalgia came with **Simple Minds**. "Don't You (Forget About Me)" might be their mainstream hit, but tunes like "Alive and Kicking" and "Sanctify Yourself" show that they‚Äôre more than just a Breakfast Club footnote.

Lastly, you can't mention Bowie without nodding to that energetic collaboration with **Mick Jagger**. "Dancing in the Street" may not be the peak of either artist's careers, but it's proof that fun doesn't always need to be serious.

## A Look Behind the Music üéß

Just to pull back the curtain a bit, all this data about my listening habits comes straight from my profile on Last.fm. You can sneak a peek if you want a more detailed look at what's been playing: [RussMckendrick's Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick).

Short but sweet ‚Äì they're not set to steal the show just yet. üòâ

## Closing Chorus üé∂

It's been a whirlwind tour of my musical week. Albums, like good friends, come and go in our lives, with some sticking around for mere moments, and others setting up camp for a lifetime. Whether it's the chameleon changes of Bowie or the poignant punch of Pearl Jam, every note strikes a chord within.

So tell me, what's been on your playlist this week? Any recommendations? I'm all ears! Drop a comment, send a tweet, or if you're into it, visit my Last.fm and maybe we can become music buddies.

Till next time, let's keep our records spinning and our hearts open to the tunes that sound the rhythm of our personal soundtrack.

Rock on, my friends, and remember‚Äîmusic is the closest thing we have to a time machine. üé∏üïí

Peace out,

Your Music Maestro üéº
