# 🎵🎧 Spin The Record: This Week's Music Hits 🎧🎵

Hey there, fellow music lovers! 🙌🏻 I've been spinning tracks from a mix of artists lately. Some of them are established favorites and others might be newcomers to your playlists. Let's dive right into it!🏊🏽‍♂️ 

Without a doubt, the MVP🥇 of my week has been the legendary *Roxy Music*. Their discography is a treasure trove full of daring risks and authentic sounds. This week "Love is the Drug" and "More Than This" made frequent appearances in my playlist. Bryan Ferry's haunting vocals paired with the band's dramatic, glam-rock vibe always manage to lure me back into their orbit. If you're looking for music with both style and substance, Roxy Music is the way to go. 🚀

While Roxy Music was my most played, it certainly wasn't my only play. In true shuffle fashion, my music selection was a colorful tapestry of different artists, influences, and eras.🎨 

I revisited the distinct sound of *U2* this week, indulging in meandering sonics infused with a raw emotional undercurrent. "With or Without You" still manages to send chills down my spine. Bono's gut-wrenching vocals make it a stand-out even after all these years. 🎸

Next up on the playlist, I jumped across the Atlantic back to the 80s with *Tears for Fears*. Songs like "Shout" and "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" never fail to evoke nostalgia with its synth-soaked melodies and compelling lyrics.🕹

From there, I hopped into the grunge era with *Stone Temple Pilots*. Their track "Plush" still holds up as one of the most earnest and gritty tracks grunge has to offer. 

My week wouldn't be complete without some good ol' indie rock with *Pixies* and *James*. Tracks like "Here Comes Your Man" (*Pixies*) and "Laid" (*James*) uplifted my mood with their cheeky lyrics and catchy guitar riffs. 

Alt-rock met punk in my play history with *Jawbreaker*. Their raw and unapologetic sound gives that needed emotional purge. Deeper into the indie realm, I discovered and fell in love with *The Anchoress*, whose powerful vocals and intricate soundscapes make for a thrilling musical journey. 

Feeling the need for some more introspective tunes, *The War on Drugs* and *Japan* hit the right notes. Both these bands have a distinctive way of blending electronic elements with traditional instruments, creating an enveloping sonic experience. 

To top it off, I ended the week on a high with *The Smashing Pumpkins* and *Mad Season*. The former's distinct alternative rock sound and the latter's bluesy grunge tones were the perfect capstones to a diverse musical week.
 
That's my recent musical escapades— a melting pot of influences and genres, from glam to grunge, from alt-rock to synth-pop. 😌 If you're interested in stalking (I mean, checking out) my playlists, you can find me on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/RussMckendrick) and rummage through my listen history. 🕵🏻‍♂️
