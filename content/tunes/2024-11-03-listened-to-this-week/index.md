### Recording Journey 🎵
The creation of *OK Computer* was anything but conventional. Recorded primarily at The Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, England, the album was produced by Nigel Godrich, who would later become Radioheads go-to collaborator. The recording sessions were marked by experimentation, as the band eschewed traditional recording techniques.
