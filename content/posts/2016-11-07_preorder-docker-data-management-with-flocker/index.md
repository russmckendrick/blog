{{< notice note >}}
This book was scrapped just before it was due to be published due to the Flocker project loosing its funding and folding.
{{< /notice >}}

I am pleased to say that my third book is now available to pre-order from [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/), [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/) & [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/).

The book is released in the new year. However, if you purchase from Packt, you will get [early access](https://www.packtpub.com/) to the ebook.
