It has been 270 days since my last post, so what I have been doing with my time?

Well, I have been busy writing, just not this blog. Not only have I wrote and released [Learn Ansible](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/learn-ansible-9781788999328), but also I have updated the [Second Edition of Mastering Docker](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/mastering-docker-9781789618686/) bringing it up to date with the release of the [Third Edition of Mastering Docker](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/mastering-docker-9781789618686) which is now available from [Packt Publishing](https://packtpub.com).

Also, according to Discogs, I have added over 250 records to [my collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/russmck/collection/covers?page=1&limit=100&layout=big&sort_by=added) ☺️, below is a playlist of some of the most recent editions:
