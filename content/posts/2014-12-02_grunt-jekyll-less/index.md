As you may have noticed, the website looks different to how it was previously. I decided it was time for a refresh and I wanted to make the design a little more interesting.

While [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) & [Github](https://pages.github.com) pages use [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) the Bootstrap theme I settled for uses [LESS](http://lesscss.org). This meant that I needed to compile all of my CSS outside of Jekyll. Most of the articles I found say use either [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) or [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), looking at the syntax of the two I preferred Grunt as it didn’t look like code.

Installation was straight forward enough;

```
brew install node
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

So now what? I needed something which would do the following …

1. Compile the LESS files
2. Combine all of the CSS files into one
3. Minify the resulting CSS files
4. Run Jekyll to build the files

After a lot of trial and error I managed to get all of the above plus the ability to have the browser automatically refresh when I change a file, which was nice :smile:

You can see what happens when I run grunt server or grunt css in the following [asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/14389) ….

My configuration currently looks like ….

**Gruntfile.js**

```
module.exports = function(grunt) {

});
require(‘load-grunt-tasks’)(grunt);
grunt.registerTask(‘default’, [‘less’, ‘concat:css’, ‘cssmin:css’, ‘jekyll’]);
grunt.registerTask(‘css’, [‘less’, ‘concat:css’, ‘cssmin:css’]);
grunt.registerTask(‘server’, [‘connect’, ‘watch’]);
};
```

The following posts helped me get to where I am at the moment;

- [Jekyll & Grunt setup](http://thomascys.be/jekyll-grunt-setup/)
- [Using Jekyll with Grunt.js (and much more)](http://blog.seanevd.com/using-jekyll-with-grunt-js/)
- [grunt-contrib-watch with LiveReload not working](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20120412/grunt-contrib-watch-with-livereload-not-working)

I plan on adding a few more options to optimise the images and also compile the Javascript into something a little more discrete, eventually you can read it here.
