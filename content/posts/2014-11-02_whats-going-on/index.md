Its been an interesting few weeks. I woke up one morning to find around 70 emails, most of them from Twitter saying a tweet I had been mentioned in had been favorited, this was the source ….

…. yay. After spending a fews months talking about [Docker](https://docker.com) at [work](https://www.reconnix.com) it was good to get a mention. Also I got mentioned in the [Docker Weekly News Letter](http://go.docker.com/webmail/44082/112029719/09492912a609c13608a6e6b4d354d457). Also this happened a few weeks later ….

…. [CenturyLink Labs](http://www.centurylinklabs.com) are a great source for leaning about Docker, so I was pretty chuffed.
