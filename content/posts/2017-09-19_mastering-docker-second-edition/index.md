It has been a while since I have posted, since Docker Bootcamp was published I have been hard at work on the second edition of Mastering Docker for [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/) which is now available from [https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mastering-docker-second-edition](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mastering-docker-second-edition) as well as Amazon and all other book stores.
