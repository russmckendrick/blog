I needed a simple way to mirror some repos, and potentially kickstart some servers at a future date. While something like [The Foreman](http://theforeman.org) would do the build side of things it doesn’t repo mirrors (yet). So I did an install of [Cobbler](http://www.cobblerd.org).

This turned out to be more stright forward than I thought, first you need to ensure [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) is enabled ….

{{< terminal title="Installing Cobbler on CentOS 6.x 1/1" >}}
```
yum install http://ftp.linux.ncsu.edu/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
yum install cobbler cobbler-web pykickstart
chkconfig cobblerd on
chkconfig xinetd on
service httpd restart
service xinetd start
service cobblerd start
service cobblerd status
cobbler get-loaders
vim /etc/cobbler/modules.conf

# Make the following changes ….

[dns]
module = manage_dnsmasq
[dhcp]
module = manage_dnsmasq

[authentication]
module = authn_configfile
[authorization]
module = authz_allowall

# once done save and run the following ….
cobbler check
cobbler sync

# cobbler sets the username and password for the web interface to cobbler / cobbler, change that by running ….
htdigest /etc/cobbler/users.digest “Cobbler” cobbler
```
{{< /terminal >}}

….. all done. You should be able to access your installation at …..
