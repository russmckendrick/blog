One of the reasons I haven’t been posting much on here for the last fews months is that I have been busy spending my weekends and evenings writing a book called “Monitoring Docker” which is being published by [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com) at the end of the year.

![pre-order](/img/2015-10-11_monitoring-docker-book_1.png)

It’s now available for pre-order from the [Packt website](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/monitoring-docker/) and also Amazon !!!

Exciting times :D
