I am pleased to able to say that I have contributed a chapter to the final book in the current [The New Stack](http://thenewstack.io/) ebook series on Docker & Containers.

![text](/img/2016-12-12_monitoring-managment-with-docker-containers-ebook_1.png)

The ebook, which is free, is called “Monitoring & Management With Docker & Containers”

> Container and service-oriented architectures present a complex challenge for monitoring and performance management. Service-driven systems have dramatically increased the number of components monitoring tools interface with. Read how developers and vendors are tackling performance and monitoring in operational and production environments, and what obstacles are unique to managing containerized systems.

The chapter I contributed is titled “Identifying And Collecting Container Data” and talks about the various ways you can not only get metrics out of your containers and host instances but also how to best use them.
