As mentioned in a [previous post](/2024/03/29/running-llms-locally-with-ollama/), I recently finished writing the second edition of Learn Ansible. This had me using Python a lot, and my one key takeaway is that managing Python has become a massive chore. Now, with the book complete, I thought I would strip back on my machine, start from scratch - or as close to clean as I could get - and develop a cleaner, more streamlined way of managing Python on my local machine.

I have tried a few methods in the pastâ€”see these posts from [December 2019](/2019/12/29/upgrade-python-on-macos/), [January 2021](/2021/01/10/managing-python-on-macos-big-sur/) and [October 2021](/2021/10/30/managing-python-on-macos-monterey/). While these worked, they quickly became a chore to maintain due to all the different things that were trying to use Python. For example, there is the version of Python built into macOS, Homebrew tries to maintain its own Python installations for packages it downloads, and then there is my stuff on top.

## Introducing Conda

I did a little research and chose Conda - which can be found [here](https://www.conda.io/). While we will cover the Conda command in this post - I am using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).

Miniconda is described as the following:

> Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages (like pip, zlib, and a few others).

So, as I wanted to keep things as simple as possible, I used Miniconda rather than the more full-fat Anaconda.

### Installing and configuring Miniconda on macOS

The installation guide for Miniconda is simple if you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you just need to run the following command:

{{< terminal title="Installing Miniconda" >}}
```
brew install miniconda
```
{{< /terminal >}}

Once installed, we must ensure it is loaded when we open our terminal. To add the right lines to `~/.zshrc` run the following command:

{{< terminal title="Update the ~/.zshrc file" >}}
```
conda init zsh
```
{{< /terminal >}}

This adds the following code to the end of `~/.zshrc`:

{{< terminal title="Contents appended to ~/.zshrc" >}}
```
# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/conda' 'shell.zsh' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize
```
{{< /terminal >}}

I have already [updated my dotfiles](/2024/04/02/updating-my-dotfiles/) to include the above and also to use the [Powerline10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) so it shows the Conda environment that is currently selected in my terminal:

{{< gallery match="images/my-terminal-prompt.png" sortOrder="assc" rowHeight="200" margins="5" thumbnailResizeOptions="600x600 q90 Lanczos" showExif=true previewType="blur" embedPreview=true loadJQuery=true >}}<br>

As you can see from the prompt above, where it shows ****base**** on the right-hand side - with ****base**** being the default environment.

## Adding an Ansible environment

In this example, I will create an environment for running Ansible; let's start by creating the environment itself.

### Creating the environment

To add an environment for running just Ansible, I ran the following command:

{{< terminal title="Creating the Ansible environment" >}}
```
conda create -n ansible python=3.12
```
{{< /terminal >}}

The command gave me the following output:

{{< terminal title="Output of the create command" >}}
```

### Activating the environment

With the dedicated Ansible environment created, we can activate using the following command: 

{{< terminal title="Activating the Ansible environment" >}}
```
conda activate ansible
```
{{< /terminal >}}

We can now check the path of the `python` binary by running `which python`:

{{< terminal title="Checking which python is being used" >}}
```
which python
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/ansible/bin/python
```
{{< /terminal >}}

As you can see, it is using the `python` binary within our environment, which means that Ansible can now be installed along with some collections:

{{< terminal title="Installing Ansible and some collections" >}}
```
python -m pip install ansible
ansible-galaxy collection install azure.azcollection
python -m pip install -r ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/azure/azcollection/requirements-azure.txt
```
{{< /terminal >}}

The screen below shows an example of what the terminal looks like when switched to the Ansible environment:

{{< gallery match="images/the-ansbile-env.png" sortOrder="assc" rowHeight="200" margins="5" thumbnailResizeOptions="600x600 q90 Lanczos" showExif=true previewType="blur" embedPreview=true loadJQuery=false >}}<br>

So far so good !!!

## Digging Deeper

Here are some notes on package management and virtual environment management. 

### Pip vs Conda

As well as being a Python environment manager, Conda also provides it own package management, so rather that running pip using 

{{< terminal title="Installing Ansible using pip" >}}
```
python -m pip install ansible
```
{{< /terminal >}}

I could have run the following command:

{{< terminal title="The Conda install command" >}}
```
conda install conda-forge::ansible
```
{{< /terminal >}}

This would install Ansible from the main [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) site, which hosts its own files at  [conda-forge/ansible](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ansible) for Ansible, if I had taken this route the installation would have looked like the following:

However, in my case, as I wanted to keep things simple - I am sticking to what I know and will use `pip`.

I did, however, add the following `alias` for `pip` in my [dotfile](https://github.com/russmckendrick/dotfiles) to call `python -m pip` each time I run the `pip` command:

```
alias pip='python -m pip'
```

This means that if I run ï¿¼`pip install ansible`ï¿¼ , the command ï¿¼`python -m pip install ansible`ï¿¼ would be run, so I can be sure that I am not calling the `pip` executable from some other random place. 

### Installing a different Python version

Now, not every piece of code supports the latest and greatest version of Python. Luckily, as you might have already guessed, we can define what version of Python to install when you create your virtual environment using Conda.

{{< terminal title="Installing Python 3.10" >}}
```
conda create -n test python=3.10
```
{{< /terminal >}}

As you can see, we are requesting that Python 3.10 be installed instead of Python 3.12, which is what our other virtual environments use.

{{< terminal title="The output of installing Python 3.10" >}}

### Managing Virtual Environments

You can list all of your virtual environments using the command below:

{{< terminal title="Listing all envs" >}}
```
conda env list
```
{{< /terminal >}}

This will return something like the following:

{{< terminal title="The output of conda env list" >}}
```
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base

test                     /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/test
```
{{< /terminal >}}

Now let's remove the test virtual environment:

{{< terminal title="Removing the test env" >}}
```
conda remove -n test --all
```
{{< /terminal >}}

This will nuke everything to do with the test virtual environment:

{{< terminal title="The output of conda remove -n test --all" >}}
```

### Updating packages

Even if, like me, you use `pip` there are still some packages managed by Conda in your Virtual environment, you can update them by switching to the virtual environment you want to update and then run:

{{< terminal title="Updating the Conda managed packages in your env" >}}
```
conda update --all
```
{{< /terminal >}}

## Conclusion

Managing Python environments can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with multiple projects and dependencies. However, by leveraging the power of Conda and Miniconda, you can streamline your Python environment management process and ensure a clean, efficient setup on your local machine.

With Conda, you can easily create isolated Python environments for different projects, specifying the exact Python version and package requirements. This allows you to maintain separate environments for each project, avoiding conflicts and ensuring compatibility.
