As mentioned in a [previous post](/2024/03/29/running-llms-locally-with-ollama/), I recently finished writing the second edition of Learn Ansible. This had me using Python a lot, and my one key takeaway is that managing Python has become a massive chore. Now, with the book complete, I thought I would strip back on my machine and start from scratch—or as close to clean as I could get—and come up with a cleaner, more streamlined way of managing Python on my local machine.
