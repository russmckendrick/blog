Yesterday, I had day out of the office with [Danny](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/danny-roberts/14/333/636) at the 2014 London [PuppetCamp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/puppetcamp). It was the first time I had attended a PuppetLabs event, though I have streamed plenty of video from past camps and conferences.

It was interesting to see how best practices had moved on (answer, lots) since I first had my Puppet epiphany over a year ago. For me, and in no order, the most interesting talks were ….

#### Augeas, swiss knife resources for your puppet tree by [Julien Pivotto](https://www.slideshare.net/roidelapluie/)

#### Can you upgrade to Puppet 4.x? by [Martin Alfke](https://www.slideshare.net/tuxmea)

#### Keeping AWS in check with Puppet by [Oholiab](https://www.slideshare.net/oholiab/)

So in all a great day, other than the early start …

It has also inspired me a enough to revisit a module I cobbled together earlier in the year which manages the installation of [Cloudwatch logs](/2014/07/22/ha-central-logging-in-aws/) and get it up to a decent standard so I can push it to the forge and be just like [Danny](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/kemra102).
