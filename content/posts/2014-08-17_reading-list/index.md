At least once a day I skim through a large number of blogs in my [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) feed using [Reeder 2](http://reederapp.com/mac/), when I see something which catches my eye I send it over to [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) so it is sync’ed to all of my devices.

Here are some of the posts I have saved for further reading ….
