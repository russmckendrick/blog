The album opens with “Section 44 (Galloping Seas),” a six-minute track that sets a dramatic and emotional tone for the album.

## I/O -  Peter Gabriel ([](https://www.mckendrick.rocks/albums/i-o-bright-side-mixes-29079523/))

Peter Gabriel's album "i/o," released in December 2023, marks his first album of new material in over two decades. The album unfolds a narrative of modern concerns and personal reflections. It was uniquely released track by track every full moon throughout 2023, creating a gradual buildup to the album's release.

Stylistically, "i/o" aligns with the tones and styles of Gabriel's earlier works, particularly "Up" and "Us." It features a blend of acoustic instruments and electronic elements, creating a rich, ambient soundscape. The album is available in two different versions: the "Bright-Side" and "Dark-Side" mixes, each offering a slightly different tonal experience but maintaining the core essence of the tracks.

The album addresses a range of themes, from surveillance culture in "Panopticom" to the complexities of cancel culture in "The Court." It also delves into deeper, more introspective themes, like the tragic naivety of corrupted religious faith in "Four Kinds of Horses" and the sobering reality of mortality in songs like "Playing for Time" and "So Much." Yet, there are moments of brightness and celebration, such as in "Road to Joy," a jubilant electro-funk track, and "Olive Tree," a soulful pop song imagining a future of enhanced human connectivity.

"i/o" has been described as a thought-provoking blend of modern concerns with personal reflections, offering a mixture of austere and jubilant moments. Gabriel's exploration of mortality, grief, and hope for renewal is a significant theme throughout the album. Despite the weight of these themes, the album closes on a hopeful note with "Live and Let Live," expressing a desire for global self-forgiveness and peace.

Overall, "i/o" is seen as a worthy addition to Peter Gabriel's catalog, reflecting his status as a future-facing artist who continues to push boundaries in music.

## Hologram - Amplifier ([](https://www.mckendrick.rocks/albums/hologram-28259452/))

"Hologram," Amplifier's first album since 2017, emerges as a strong and diverse addition to the band's catalog. Not originally intended as their next album, "Hologram" was created in the Autumn of 2022, during sessions for another project, "Gargantuan," which is yet to be released. Realizing that the material from these sessions didn't quite fit the "Gargantuan" project, the band decided to release it as "Hologram."

The album showcases Amplifier's signature style, blending philosophical and abstract lyrical content with a slightly dystopian and sci-fi ambiance, reminiscent of the works of Philip K. Dick. The band's evolution is evident, ranging from their crunchier, early rock albums to the full-on prog rock of "The Octopus," and then to the more subtle art rock of "Echo Street." Amplifier's music is described as a celebration of the transcendent nature of rock music as escapism.

Tracks like "Two Way Mirror" display classic Amplifier riffs with stoner tones, while "Sweet Perfume" presents a weirdly dissonant sound aiming at vacuous celebrity. The title track "Hologram" offers a more atmospheric soundscape with soft, dream-like vocals. "Tundra" is a standout piece, showcasing fluid drumming and layered guitars, while "Let Me Drive" returns to a theme with infectious synths and a groove guitar riff. The final song, "Gargantuan, Part One," hints at what might be expected in the next full album.

"Hologram" is a journey of just 36 minutes, but it's praised for its quality rather than length, offering a glimpse into what the future holds for Amplifier's music. The album has been well-received for its high quality, marking a welcome return for the band and generating excitement for their upcoming project "Gargantuan."

## Pearlies - Emma Anderson ([](https://www.mckendrick.rocks/albums/pearlies-28653319/))

"Pearlies," the solo debut album from Emma Anderson, known for her work with Lush, is a significant return to the music scene. Released following the final breakup of Lush in 2016, "Pearlies" showcases Anderson's journey back into the spotlight with a collection of songs that revisit the gauzy sound of Lush's early shoegaze years. The album diverges from the brasher Britpop era of Lush, instead embracing a more atmospheric and dream-pop approach.

The album stands out for its melodic quality, reminiscent of Lush's early era, yet explores more adventurous and richer sounds. Tracks like "I Was Miles Away" demonstrate Anderson's crystalline vocals and distinctive melodies, while "Bend The Round" and "Willow And Mallow" present a more haunting and spectral side, hinting at influences like Vashti Bunyan and Shirley Collins. The album also features a cinematic quality, influenced by Anderson's initial plans to develop the music for film and TV soundtracks. 

"Pearlies" is not just a nostalgic trip to shoegaze but a step into broader musical landscapes, combining the sickly-sweet quality of 60s TV drama themes with an undercurrent of eeriness. The album's strongest tracks are noted for their haunting quality, blending light-filled soundscapes with a sense of otherworldly melancholy. 

Overall, "Pearlies" is a glowingly lovely and nicely crafted record that shows Anderson's ability to create music that is both soothing and subtly unsettling. It serves as a polished, less urgent version of Lush, displaying Anderson's expertise in crafting neo-shoegaze music with a distinctive charm.

## Simplicity - Matt Berry ([](https://www.mckendrick.rocks/albums/simplicity-28940773/))

Matt Berry's 2023 album "Simplicity" is a distinctive and innovative work, created in collaboration with the library music label KPM.

## Joy'All - Jenny Lewis ([](https://www.mckendrick.rocks/albums/joy-all-27328932/))

"Joy'All," the fifth solo album by Jenny Lewis, released in 2023, marks a significant step in her artistic journey. The album, recorded entirely in Nashville, is imbued with a country tinge, but it also reflects the complexity of emotions that Lewis is known for, as the former lead singer of Rilo Kiley.

"Joy'All" is characterized by its light and breezy sound, a surprising element considering it was born out of a pandemic project. The album is a beautiful amalgamation of Lewis' trademark wit, soulful ruminations, and insightful observations on life. Songs like "Puppy And A Track" stand out for their classic rock atmosphere, enhanced by little touches of pedal steel, encapsulating Lewis's experience with a mid-life crisis in a lighthearted, yet profound way.

The title track, "Joy’All," recalls the style of Ani DiFranco, a former collaborator of Lewis, and is marked by handclaps, vocalizations, and multi-tracked harmonies. "Psychos," the opening track, showcases Lewis's witty lyricism, while "Giddy Up" is seductive and laidback, demonstrating her versatility as an artist. 

"Apples And Oranges" and "Balcony" are tracks where Lewis delves into deeper emotional territories, touching upon themes of loss and longing. "Essence Of Life" stands out for its moody waltz rhythm and Lewis' ominously sparse vocal approach. The album also features an infusion of FM radio sheen in its production, adding a contemporary touch to the music.

"Joy'All" has been likened to the work of Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks, reflecting a soft rock ethos reminiscent of California's golden era of singer-songwriters. The album is described as adult pop/rock with an attitude, showcasing Lewis's growth and maturity as an artist.

Overall, "Joy'All" is celebrated as possibly Jenny Lewis's best solo work to date, embodying her fearless confrontation with middle age and the complexities it brings.
