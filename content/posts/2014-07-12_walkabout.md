I have been missing in action for a while, busy with work and other “stuff”. Since I last posted …..

- I have written a [blog post for work](http://www.reconnix.com/2014/07/07/multi-factor-authentication-in-aws/) on MFA in AWS.

….. suppose I had better make more of an effort to post now that everything has caught up.
