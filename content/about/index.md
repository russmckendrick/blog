I am an experienced DevOps practitioner and system administrator with a passion for automation and containers. I have been working in IT and related industries for the better part of 25 years. During my career, I have had varied responsibilities in many different sectors, ranging from looking after an entire IT infrastructure to providing first-line, second-line, and senior support in both client-facing and internal teams for small and large organisations.

I work almost exclusively with Linux, using open-source systems and tools across both dedicated hardware and virtual machines hosted in public and private clouds at [Node4](https://www.node4.co.uk/), where I am the Practice Manager of SRE & DevOps.

In my spare time, I have written and contributed to eleven books ...

- "[Monitoring Docker](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/monitoring-docker)"
- "[Extending Docker](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/extending-docker)"
