## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The `src/components/` directory contains Astro components, including layout components, embed components, and UI elements.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog/` as `.md` or `.mdx` files. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts and type-check your frontmatter using the schema defined in `src/content.config.ts`. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run post`            | Create a new blog post with proper structure     |

### Creating a New Blog Post

Run `npm run post` to create a new blog post with the proper structure. The interactive script will:

1. Prompt you for:
   - Post title
   - Description
   - Tags (comma-separated)
   - Table of contents preference (y/n)

2. Automatically generate:
   - MDX file in `src/content/blog/` with format: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx`
   - Assets directory in `src/assets/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/`
   - Complete frontmatter with all required fields
   - Draft status set to `true` for safety

3. Provide you with:
   - File locations for the post and cover image
   - The future URL path for the post
   - Next steps to publish

**Example:**
```bash
npm run post

# Prompts:
# Post title: My Awesome Post
# Description: A description of my post
# Tags: docker, kubernetes, devops
# Show table of contents? (y/n): y

# Creates:
# - src/content/blog/2025-10-01-my-awesome-post.mdx
# - src/assets/2025-10-01-my-awesome-post/ (for cover image)
# - Post URL: /2025/10/01/my-awesome-post
```
